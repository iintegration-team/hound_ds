chemical elements, structured by their atomic number, electron configuration and recurring chemical properties In the basic form, elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number, in the reading sequence Then, rows and columns are created by starting new rows and inserting blank cells, so that rows (periods) and columns (groups) show elements with recurring properties (called periodicity) For example, all elements in group (column) 18 are noble gases that are largely‚Äîthough not completely‚Äîunreactive The history of the periodic table reflects over two centuries of growth in the understanding of the chemical and physical properties of the elements, with major contributions made by Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier, Johann Wolfgang D√∂bereiner, John Newlands, Julius Lothar Meyer, Dmitri Mendeleev, Glenn T Seaborg, and others[1][2] Early history[edit] Further information: Classical element Around 330 BCE, the Greek philosopher Aristotle proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more roots, an idea originally suggested by the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles The four roots, which the Athenian philosopher Plato called elements, were earth, water, air and fire Similar ideas existed in other ancient traditions, such as Indian philosophy with five elements: Earth, water, fire, air and aether collectively called 'pa√±ca bh≈´ta'[3] Of the chemical elements shown on the periodic table, nine ‚Äì carbon, sulfur, iron, copper, silver, tin, gold, mercury, and lead ‚Äì have been known since antiquity, as they are found in their native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools[4] Five more elements were known in the age of alchemy: zinc, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth[citation needed] Platinum was known to pre-Columbian South Americans, but knowledge of it did not reach Europe until the 16th century[citation needed] First classification[edit] Hennig Brand, as shown in The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus The history of the periodic table is also a history of the discovery of the chemical elements The first person in recorded history to discover a new element was Hennig Brand, a bankrupt German merchant Brand tried to discover the philosopher's stone‚Äîa mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base metals into gold In 1669, or later, his experiments with distilled human urine resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \\\"cold fire\\\" (kaltes Feuer)[5] He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Anglo-Irish[6] chemist Robert Boyle rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings The discovery of phosphorus helped to raise the question of what it meant for a substance (any given variety of matter) to be an element, in a world where versions of atomic theory were only speculative and later understandings of the nature of substances were only beginning to become possible In 1661, Boyle defined elements as \\\"those primitive and simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into which they are ultimately resolved\\\"[7] In 1718, √âtienne Fran√ßois Geoffroy's Affinity Table made use of several aspects ‚Äî (1) tabular grouping and (2) correlation with chemical affinity ‚Äî that would later be reprised Geoffroy's 1718 Affinity Table: at the head of each column is a chemical species with which all the species below can combine Some historians have defined this table as being the start of the chemical revolution[8] In 1789, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier wrote Trait√© √âl√©mentaire de Chimie (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry), which is considered to be the first modern textbook about chemistry Lavoisier defined an element as a substance whose smallest units cannot be broken down into a simpler substance[9] Lavoisier's book contained a list of \\\"simple substances\\\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, mercury, zinc and sulfur, which formed the basis for the modern list of elements Lavoisier's list also included \\\"light\\\" and \\\"caloric\\\", which at the time were believed to be material substances He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals While many leading chemists refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the Elementary Treatise was written well enough to convince the younger generation However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals Dalton's 1806 list of known elements by atomic weight In 1808‚Äì10, British natural philosopher John Dalton published a method by which to arrive at provisional atomic weights for the elements known in his day, from stoichiometric measurements and reasonable inferences Dalton's atomic theory was adopted by many chemists during the 1810s and 1820s In 1815, British physician and chemist William Prout noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen[10][11] In 1817, German physicist Johann Wolfgang D√∂bereiner began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements[12] In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties He termed these groups triads[13] Definition of Triad law \\\"Chemically analogous elements arranged in increasing order of their atomic weights formed well marked groups of three called Triads in which the atomic weight of the middle element was found to be generally the arithmetic mean of the atomic weight of the other two elements in the triad chlorine, bromine, and iodine calcium, strontium, and barium sulfur, selenium, and tellurium lithium, sodium, and potassium\\\" All those attempts to sort elements by atomic weights were inhibited by the inaccurate determination of weights, and not just slightly: carbon, oxygen and many other elements were believed to be half their actual masses (cf the illustration by Dalton above), because only monatomic gases were believed to exist[14] Even though Amedeo Avogadro and, independently of him, Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, proposed the solution in the form of diatomic molecules and Avogadro's law already in the 1810s, it was not until after Stanislao Cannizzaro's publications in late 1850s when the theory began to be widely considered In 1860, the modern scientific consensus emerged at the first international chemical conference, the Karlsruhe Congress, and a revised list of elements and atomic masses was adopted It helped spur creation of more extensive systems The first such system emerged in two years[15] Comprehensive formalizations[edit] Properties of the elements, and thus properties of light and heavy bodies formed by them, are in a periodic dependence on their atomic weight‚Äî Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, formulating the periodic law for the first time in his 1871 article \\\"Periodic regularity of the chemical elements\\\"[16] French geologist Alexandre-√âmile B√©guyer de Chancourtois noticed that the elements, when ordered by their atomic weights, displayed similar properties at regular intervals In 1862, he devised a three-dimensional chart, named the \\\"telluric helix\\\", after the element tellurium, which fell near the center of his diagram[17][18] With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois saw that elements with similar properties lined up vertically The original paper from Chancourtois in Comptes rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences did not include a chart and used geological rather than chemical terms In 1863, he extended his work by including a chart and adding ions and compounds[19] The next attempt was made in 1864 British chemist John Newlands presented in Chemical News[20] a classification of the 62 known elements Newlands noticed recurring trends in physical properties of the elements at recurring intervals of multiples of eight in order of mass number;[21] based on this observation, he produced a classification of these elements into eight groups Each group displayed a similar progression; Newlands likened these progressions to the progression of notes within a musical scale[18][22][23][24] Newlands's table left no gaps for possible future elements, and in some cases had two elements at the same position in the same octave Newlands's table was ignored or ridiculed by some of his contemporaries[20] The Chemical Society refused to publish his work The president of the Society, William Odling, defended the Society's decision by saying that such \\\"theoretical\\\" topics might be controversial;[25] there was even harsher opposition from within the Society, suggesting the elements could have been just as well listed alphabetically[15] Later that year, Odling suggested a table of his own[26] but failed to get recognition following his role in opposing Newlands's table[25] German chemist Lothar Meyer also noted the sequences of similar chemical and physical properties repeated at periodic intervals According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates (ie vertically) and the atomic volumes as abscissas (ie horizontally)‚Äîthe curve obtained is a series of maximums and minimums‚Äîthe most electropositive elements would appear at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their valence‚Äîfor the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights[27] In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death[4] In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent[citation needed] In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev arranged 63 elements by increasing atomic weight in several columns, noting recurring chemical properties across them It is sometimes said that he played \\\"chemical solitaire\\\" on long train journeys,[28] using cards containing the symbols, atomic weights, and chemical properties of the known elements[29] Another possibility is that he was inspired in part by the periodicity of the Sanskrit alphabet, which was pointed out to him by his friend and linguist Otto von B√∂htlingk[30] Mendeleev used the trends he saw to suggest that atomic weights of some elements were incorrect, and accordingly changed their placements: for instance, he figured there was no place for a trivalent beryllium with the atomic weight of 14 in his work, and he cut both the atomic weight and valency of beryllium by a third, suggesting it was a divalent element with the atomic weight of 94 Mendeleev widely distributed printed broadsheets of the table to various chemists in Russia and abroad[31][32][33] Mendeleev argued in 1869 there were seven types of highest oxides[34][a] Mendeleev continued to improve his ordering; in 1870, it gained a tabular shape, and each column was given its own highest oxide,[35] and in 1871, he further developed it and formulated what he termed the \\\"law of periodicity\\\"[16] Some changes also occurred with new revisions, with some elements changing positions Various attempts to construct a comprehensive formalization Meyer's periodic table, published in \\\"Die modernen Theorien der Chemie\\\", 1864[27] Newlands's law of octaves, 1866 Mendeleev's first Attempt at a system of

scientific idea who perceives not merely its philosophical, but its real aspect, and who understands so to illustrate the matter so that everyone can become convinced of its truth Then alone the idea, like matter, becomes indestructible‚Äî Mendeleev in his 1881 article in British journal Chemical News in a correspondence debate with Meyer over priority of the periodic table invention[36]

(1937) Eka-tantalum 235 231 Protactinium (1917) Even as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and that the properties of such undiscovered elements could be deduced from their expected relationships with other elements In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed predictions for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium;[39] he also more briefly noted a few other expectations[40] It has been proposed that the prefixes eka, dvi, and tri, Sanskrit for one, two, and three, respectively, are a tribute to PƒÅ·πáini and other ancient Sanskrit grammarians for their invention of a periodic alphabet[30] In 1871, Mendeleev expanded his predictions further Compared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then known elements: indium, thorium, and five rare-earth metals: yttrium, cerium, lanthanum, erbium, and didymium The last two were later found to be mixtures of two different elements; ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev as they did not show a regular increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights[41] Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series[c] In early 1870, he decided that the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare-earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increased their predicted atomic weights by half) He measured the heat capacity of indium, uranium, and cerium to demonstrate their higher assumed valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist Robert Bunsen)[42] Mendeleev treated the change by assessing each element to an individual place in his system of the elements rather than continuing to treat them as a series Mendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between cerium and tantalum with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew tungsten)[43] This row would begin with a trivalent lanthanum, a tetravalent cerium, and a pentavalent didymium However, the higher valency for didymium had not been established, and Mendeleev tried to do so himself[44] Having had no success in that, he abandoned his attempts to incorporate the rare-earth metals in late 1871 and embarked on his grand idea of luminiferous ether His idea was carried on by Austrian-Hungarian chemist Bohuslav Brauner, who sought to find a place in the periodic table for the rare-earth metals;[45] Mendeleev later referred to him as to \\\"one of the true consolidators of the periodic law\\\"[d] In addition to the predictions of scandium, gallium, and germanium that were quickly realized, Mendeleev's 1871 table left many more spaces for undiscovered elements, though he did not provide detailed predictions of their properties In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered[47] Priority of discovery[edit] None of the proposals were accepted immediately, and many contemporary chemists found it too abstract to have any meaningful value Of those chemists that proposed their categorizations, Mendeleev strove to back his work and promote his vision of periodicity, Meyer did not promote his work very actively, and Newlands did not make a single attempt to gain recognition abroad[citation needed] Both Mendeleev and Meyer created their respective tables for their pedagogical needs; the difference between their tables is well explained by the fact that the two chemists sought to use a formalized system to solve different problems[48] Mendeleev's intent was to aid composition of his textbook, Foundations of Chemistry, whereas Meyer was rather concerned with presentation of theories[48] Mendeleev's predictions emerged outside of the pedagogical scope in the realm of journal science,[49] while Meyer made no predictions at all and explicitly stated his table and his textbook it was contained in, Modern Theories, should not be used for prediction in order to make the point to his students to not make too many purely theoretically constructed projections[50] Mendeleev and Meyer differed in temperament, at least when it came to promotion of their respective works Boldness of Mendeleev's predictions was noted by some contemporary chemists, however skeptical they may have been[51] Meyer referred to Mendeleev's \\\"boldness\\\" in an edition of Modern Theories, whereas Mendeleev mocked Meyer's indecisiveness to predict in an edition of Foundations of Chemistry[51] Recognition of Mendeleev's table[edit] Eventually, the periodic table was appreciated for its descriptive power and for finally systematizing the relationship between the elements,[52] although such appreciation was not universal[53] In 1881, Mendeleev and Meyer had an argument via an exchange of articles in British journal Chemical News over priority of the periodic table, which included an article from Mendeleev, one from Meyer, one of critique of the notion of periodicity, and many more[54] In 1882, the Royal Society in London awarded the Davy Medal to both Mendeleev and Meyer for their work to classify the elements; although two of Mendeleev's predicted elements had been discovered by then, Mendeleev's predictions were not at all mentioned in the prize rationale The oldest surviving periodic table for educational purpose, between 1879 and 1886 Wardlaw Museum, the University of St Andrews It includes gallium and scandium, but not germanium Mendeleev's eka-aluminium was discovered in 1875 and became known as gallium; eka-boron and eka-silicium were discovered in 1879 and 1886, respectively, and were named scandium and germanium[18] Mendeleev was even able to correct some initial measurements with his predictions, including the first prediction of gallium, which matched eka-aluminium fairly closely but had a different density Mendeleev advised the discoverer, French chemist Paul-√âmile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, to measure the density again; de Boisbaudran was initially skeptical (not least because he thought Mendeleev was trying to take credit from him) but eventually admitted the correctness of the prediction Mendeleev contacted all three discoverers; all three noted the close similarity of their discovered elements with Mendeleev's predictions, with the last of them, German chemist Clemens Winkler, admitting this suggestion was not first made by Mendeleev or himself after the correspondence with him, but by a different person, German chemist Hieronymous Theodor Richter[e] Some contemporary chemists were not convinced by these discoveries, noting the dissimilarities between the new elements and the predictions or claiming those similarities that did exist were coincidental[53] However, success of Mendeleev's predictions helped spread the word about his periodic table[56] Later, chemists used the successes of these Mendeleev's predictions to justify his table[15] By 1890, Mendeleev's periodic table had been universally recognized as a piece of basic chemical knowledge[57] Apart from his own correct predictions, a number of aspects may have contributed to this, such as the correct accommodation of many elements whose atomic weights were thought to have wrong values but were later corrected[56] The debate on the position of the rare-earth metals helped spur the discussion about the table as well[56][f] In 1889, Mendeleev noted at the Faraday Lecture to the Royal Institution in London that he had not expected to live long enough \\\"to mention their discovery to the Chemical Society of Great Britain as a confirmation of the exactitude and generality of the periodic law\\\"[58] Inert gases and ether[edit] The great value of Newland's, Mendeleef's, and Lothar Meyer's generalisation, known as the periodic arrangement of the elements, is universally acknowledged But a study of this arrangement, it must be allowed, is a somewhat tantalising pleasure; for, although the properties of elements do undoubtedly vary qualitatively, and, indeed, show approximate quantitative relations to their position in the periodic table, yet there are inexplicable deviations from regularity, which hold forth hopes of the discovery of a still more far-reaching generalisation What that generalisation may be is not yet to be divined; but that it must underlie what is known, and must furnish a clue to the explanation of irregularities, cannot be disputed ‚Äî British chemists William Ramsay and Morris Travers in 1900 discussion of their research of new inert gases[59] Inert gases[edit] British chemist Henry Cavendish, the discoverer of hydrogen in 1766, discovered that air is composed of more gases than nitrogen and oxygen[60] He recorded these findings in 1784 and 1785; among them, he found a then-unidentified gas less reactive than nitrogen Helium was first reported in 1868; the report was based on the new technique of spectroscopy; some spectral lines in light emitted by the Sun did not match those of any of the known elements Mendeleev was not convinced by this finding since variance of temperature led to change of intensity of spectral lines and their location on the spectrum[61] This opinion was held by some other scientists of the day, some of whom believed the spectral lines were due to a particular state of hydrogen existing in the Sun's atmosphere Others believed the spectral lines could belong to an element that occurred on the Sun but not on Earth; some believed it was yet to be found on Earth[62] In 1894, British chemist William Ramsay and British physicist Lord Rayleigh isolated argon from air and determined that it was a new element Argon, however, did not engage in any chemical reactions and was‚Äîhighly unusually for a gas‚Äîmonatomic;[g] it did not fit into the periodic law and thus challenged the very notion of it Not all scientists immediately accepted this report; Mendeleev's original response was that argon was a triatomic form of nitrogen rather than an element of its own[64] While the notion of a possibility of a group between that of halogens and that of alkali metals had existed (some scientists believed that several atomic weight values between halogens and alkali metals were missing, especially since places in this half of group VIII remained vacant),[65] argon did not easily match the position between chlorine and potassium because its atomic weight exceeded those of both chlorine and potassium[66] Other explanations were proposed; for example, Ramsay supposed argon could be a mixture of different gases[66] For a while, Ramsay believed argon could be a mixture of three gases of similar atomic weights; this triad would resemble the triad of iron, cobalt, and nickel, and be similarly placed in group VIII[67] Certain that shorter periods contain triads of gases at their ends, Ramsay suggested in 1898 the existence of a gas between helium and argon with an atomic weight of 20; after its discovery later that year (it was named neon), Ramsay continued to interpret it as a member of a horizontal triad at the end of that period[68] In 1896, Ramsay tested a report of American chemist William Francis Hillebrand, who found a stream of an unreactive gas from a sample of uraninite Wishing to prove it was nitrogen, Ramsay analyzed a different uranium mineral, cleveite, and found a new element, which he named krypton This finding was corrected by British chemist William Crookes, who matched its spectrum to that of the Sun's helium[69] Following this discovery, Ramsay, using fractional distillation to separate the components air, discovered several more such gases in 1898:[70] metargon, krypton, neon, and xenon; detailed spectroscopic analysis of the first of these demonstrated it was argon contaminated by a carbon-based impurity[71] Ramsay was initially skeptical about the existence of gases heavier than argon, and the discovery of krypton and xenon came as a surprise to him; however, Ramsay accepted his own discovery, and the five newly discovered inert gases (now noble gases) were placed in a single column in the periodic table[72] Although Mendeleev's table predicted several undiscovered elements, it did not predict the existence of such inert gases, and Mendeleev originally rejected those findings as well[73][h] Changes to the periodic table[edit] Although the sequence of atomic weights suggested that inert gases should be located between halogens and alkali metals, and there were suggestions to put them into group VIII coming from as early as 1895,[75] such placement contradicted one of Mendeleev's basic considerations, that of the highest oxides Inert gases did not form any oxides, and no other compounds at all, and as such, their placement in a group where elements should form tetroxides was seen as merely auxiliary and not natural; Mendeleev doubted inclusion of those elements in group VIII[75] Later developments, particularly by British scientists, focused on correspondence of inert gases with halogens to their left and alkali metals to their right In 1898, when only helium, argon, and krypton were definitively known, Crookes suggested these elements be placed in a single column between the hydrogen group and the fluorine group[76] In 1900, at the Prussian Academy of Sciences, Ramsay and Mendeleev discussed the new inert gases and their location in the periodic table; Ramsay proposed that these elements be put in a new group between halogens and alkali metals, to which Mendeleev agreed[56] Ramsay published an article after his discussions with Mendeleev; the tables in it featured halogens to the left of inert gases and alkali metals to the right[77] Two weeks before that discussion, Belgian botanist L√©o Errera had proposed to the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium to put those elements in a new group 0 In 1902, Mendeleev wrote that those elements should be put in a new group 0; he said this idea was consistent with what Ramsay suggested to him and referred to Errera as to the first person to suggest the idea[78] Mendeleev himself added these elements to the table as group 0 in 1902, without disturbing the basic concept of the periodic table[78][79] In 1905, Swiss chemist Alfred Werner resolved the dead zone of Mendeleev's table He determined that the rare-earth elements (lanthanides), 13 of which were known, lay within that gap Although Mendeleev knew of lanthanum, cerium, and erbium, they were previously unaccounted for in the table because their total number and exact order were not known; Mendeleev still could not fit them in his table by 1901[73] This was in part a consequence of their similar chemistry and the imprecise determination of their atomic masses Combined with the lack of a known group of similar elements, this rendered the placement of the lanthanides in the periodic table difficult[80] This discovery led to a restructuring of the table and the first appearance of the 32-column form[81] Ether[edit] By 1904, Mendeleev's table rearranged several elements, and included the noble gases along with most other newly discovered elements It still had the dead zone, and a row zero was added above hydrogen and helium to include coronium and the ether, which were widely believed to be elements at the time[81] Although the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment in 1887 cast doubt on the possibility of a luminiferous ether as a space-filling medium, physicists set constraints for its properties[82] Mendeleev believed it to be a very light gas, with an atomic weight several orders of magnitude smaller than that of hydrogen He also postulated that it would rarely interact with other elements, similar to the noble gases of his group zero, and instead permeate substances at a velocity of 2,250 kilometers (1,400 mi) per second[i] Mendeleev was not satisfied with the lack of understanding of the nature of this periodicity; this would only be possible through the understanding of the composition of the atom However, Mendeleev firmly believed that future would only develop the notion rather than challenge it and reaffirmed his belief in writing in 1902[83] Early developments of Mendeleev's table Main table of the periodic table published by Australian chemist David Orme Masson in 1895 Fragment of a periodic table published by Ramsay in 1896 Fragment of a periodic table published by Ramsay in 1900 Periodic table as published by Errera in 1900 Mendeleev's 1904 table It includes the noble gases in group 0, and it has two reserved gaps for coronium and ether Werner's 32-column 1905 table This table left spaces for many then-unknown elements, and several elements had their positions revised following advances in atomic theory Atomic theory and isotopes[edit] Radioactivity and isotopes[edit] Photographic recording of the characteristic X-ray emission lines of elements with atomic number between 20 and 29 (From works of Henry Moseley)Main articles: Radioactive decay and Isotope In 1907 it was discovered that thorium and radiothorium, products of radioactive decay, were physically different but chemically identical; this led Frederick Soddy to propose in 1910 that they were the same element but with different atomic weights[84] Soddy later proposed to call these elements with complete chemical identity \\\"isotopes\\\"[85] The problem of placing isotopes in the periodic table had arisen beginning in 1900 when four radioactive elements were known: radium, actinium, thorium, and uranium These radioactive elements (termed \\\"radioelements\\\") were accordingly placed at the bottom of the periodic table, as they were known to have greater atomic weights than stable elements, although their exact order was not known Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the decay chains of thorium and uranium were extensively studied Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas radon, and their chemical properties were investigated[18] By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium American chemist Bertram Boltwood proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead These were thought at the time to be new chemical elements, substantially increasing the number of known \\\"elements\\\" and leading to speculations that their discoveries would undermine the concept of the periodic table which had long been established to obey the octet rule[47] For example, there was not enough room between lead and uranium to accommodate these discoveries, even assuming that some discoveries were duplicates or incorrect identifications It was also believed that radioactive decay violated one of the central principles of the periodic table, namely that chemical elements could not undergo transmutations and always had unique identities[18] Soddy and Kazimierz Fajans, who had been following these developments, published in 1913 that although these substances emitted different radiation,[86] many of these substances were identical in their chemical characteristics, so shared the same place in the periodic table[87][88] They became known as isotopes, from the Greek isos topos (\\\"same place\\\")[18][89] Austrian chemist Friedrich Paneth cited a difference between \\\"real elements\\\" (elements) and \\\"simple substances\\\" (isotopes), also determining that the existence of different isotopes was mostly irrelevant in determining chemical properties[47] Following British physicist Charles Glover Barkla's discovery of characteristic X-rays emitted from metals in 1906, British physicist Henry Moseley considered a possible correlation between X-ray emissions and physical properties of elements Moseley, along with Charles Galton Darwin, Niels Bohr, and George de Hevesy, proposed that the nuclear charge (Z) might be mathematically related to physical properties[90] The significance of these atomic properties was determined in the Geiger‚ÄìMarsden experiments, in which the atomic nucleus and its charge were discovered, conducted between 1908 and 1913[91] Rutherford model and atomic number[edit] Main articles: Rutherford model and Atomic number In 1913, amateur Dutch physicist Antonius van den Broek was the first to propose that the atomic number (nuclear charge) determined the placement of elements in the periodic table He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 (tin), though he made several errors with heavier elements However, Van den Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements[90] Moseley was determined to test Van den Broek's hypothesis[90] After a year of investigation of the Fraunhofer lines of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray wavelength of an element and its atomic number[92] With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place argon (Z = 18) before potassium (Z = 19), cobalt (Z = 27) before nickel (Z = 28), as well as tellurium (Z = 52) before iodine (Z = 53), in line with periodic trends The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare-earth elements; it was also used to confirm that Georges Urbain's claimed discovery of a new rare-earth element (celtium) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique[90] Swedish physicist Karl Siegbahn continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (Z = 79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, uranium, had atomic number 92 In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43 (technetium), 61 (promethium), 72 (hafnium), 75 (rhenium), 85 (astatine), and 87 (francium)[90] Electron shell and quantum mechanics[edit] In 1888,[93] Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg working from the 1885 Balmer formula noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2¬∑12, 10 = 2(12 + 22), 18 = 2(12 + 22 + 22), 36 = 2(12 + 22 + 22 + 32), 54 = 2(12 + 22 + 22 + 32 + 32), 86 = 2(12 + 22 + 22 + 32 + 32 + 42) This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table, in group 0, to the right, in group VIII[78] Unwillingness of the noble gases to engage in chemical reaction was explained in the alluded stability of closed noble gas electron configurations; from this notion emerged the octet rule originally referred to as Abegg's Rule of 1904[94] Among the notable works that established the importance of the periodicity of eight were the valence bond theory, published in 1916 by American chemist Gilbert N Lewis[95] and the octet theory of chemical bonding, published in 1919 by American chemist Irving Langmuir[96][97] The chemists' approach during the period of the Old Quantum Theory (1913 to 1925) was incorporated into the understanding of the electron shells and orbitals under current quantum mechanics A real pioneer who gave us the foundation for our current model of electrons is Irving Langmuir In his 1919 paper, he postulated the existence of \\\"cells\\\", which we now call orbitals, which could each only contain two electrons, and these were arranged in \\\"equidistant layers\\\" which we now call shells He made an exception for the first shell to only contain two electrons These postulates were introduced on the basis of Rydberg's rule which Niels Bohr had used not in chemistry, but in physics, to apply to the orbits of electrons around the nucleus In the Langmuir paper, he introduced the rule as 2N2 where N was a positive integer[98] The chemist Charles Rugeley Bury made the next major step toward our modern theory in 1921, by suggesting that eight and eighteen electrons in a shell form stable configurations Bury's scheme was built upon that of earlier chemists and was a chemical model Bury proposed that the electron configurations in transitional elements depended upon the valency electrons in their outer shell[99] In some early papers, the model was called the \\\"Bohr-Bury Atom\\\" He introduced the word transition to describe the elements now known as transition metals or transition elements[100] In the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into quantum mechanics led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table In the 19th century, Mendeleev had already asserted that there was a fixed periodicity of eight, and expected a mathematical correlation between atomic number and chemical properties[101] The Bohr model was developed beginning 1913, and championed the idea of electron configurations that determine chemical properties Bohr proposed that elements in the same group behaved similarly because they have similar electron configurations, and that noble gases had filled valence shells;[102] this forms the basis of the modern octet rule Bohr's study of spectroscopy and chemistry was not usual among theoretical atomic physicists Even Rutherford told Bohr that he was struggling \\\"to form an idea of how you arrive at your conclusions\\\"[103] This is because none of the quantum mechanical equations describe the number of electrons per shell and orbital Bohr acknowledged that he was influenced by the work of Walther Kossel, who in 1916 was the first to establish an important connection between the quantum atom and the periodic table He noticed that the difference between the atomic numbers 2, 10, 18 of the first three noble gases, helium, neon, argon, was 8, and argued that the electrons in such atoms orbited in \\\"closed shells\\\" The first contained only 2 electrons, the second and third, 8 each[104][105] Bohr's research then led Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli to investigate the length of periods in the periodic table in 1924 Pauli demonstrated that this was not the case Instead, the Pauli exclusion principle was developed, not upon a mathematical basis, but upon the previous developments in alignment with chemistry[106] This rule states that no electrons can coexist in the same quantum state, and showed, in conjunction with empirical observations, the existence of four quantum numbers and the consequence on the order of shell filling[102] This determines the order in which electron shells are filled and explains the periodicity of the periodic table British chemist Charles Bury is credited with the first use of the term transition metal in 1921 to refer to elements between the main-group elements of groups II and III He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist Gilbert N Lewis, suggested the appearance of the d subshell in period 4 and the f subshell in period 6, lengthening the periods from 8 to 18 and then 18 to 32 elements, thus explaining the position of the lanthanides in the periodic table[107] Proton and neutron[edit] Main articles: Proton and Neutron The discovery of proton and neutron demonstrated that an atom was divisible; this rendered Lavoisier's definition of a chemical element obsolete A chemical element is defined today as a species of atoms with a consistent number of protons[108] and that number is now known to be precisely the atomic number of an element The discovery also explained the mechanism of several types of radioactive decay, such as alpha decay Eventually, it was proposed that protons and neutrons were made of even smaller particles called quarks; their discovery explained the transmutation of neutrons into protons in beta decay From short form into long form (into -A and -B groups)[edit] The periodic table on the wall of a chemistry lecture hall in Munich, Germany (1909) Circa 1925, the periodic table changed by shifting some Reihen (series) to the right, into an extra set of columns (groups) The original groups I‚ÄìVII were repeated, distinguished by adding \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\" Group VIII (with three columns) remained sole Thus, Reihen 4 and 5 were shifted, and together formed new period 4 with groups IA‚ÄìVIIA, VIII, IB‚ÄìVIIB Development of Reihen/periods and Gruppen/groups in the Periodic table

periodic table[edit] We already feel that we have neared the moment when this [periodic] law begins to change, and change fast‚Äî Russian physicist Yuri Oganessian, co-discoverer of several superheavy elements, in 2019[109] Actinides[edit] As early as 1913, Bohr's research on electronic structure led physicists such as Johannes Rydberg to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements heavier than uranium Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the seventh period should resemble those in the sixth Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare-earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93) The elements from actinium to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high oxidation states; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6[110] In 1940, neptunium and plutonium were the first transuranic elements to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath rhenium and osmium, respectively However, preliminary investigations of their chemistry suggested a greater similarity to uranium than to lighter transition metals, challenging their placement in the periodic table[111] During his Manhattan Project research in 1943, American chemist Glenn T Seaborg experienced unexpected difficulties in isolating the elements americium and curium, as they were believed to be part of a fourth series of transition metals Seaborg wondered if these elements belonged to a different series, which would explain why their chemical properties, in particular the instability of higher oxidation states, were different from predictions[111] In 1945, against the advice of colleagues, he proposed a significant change to Mendeleev's table: the actinide series[110][112] Seaborg's actinide concept of heavy element electronic structure proposed that the actinides form an inner transition series analogous to the rare-earth series of lanthanide elements‚Äîthey would comprise the second row of the f-block (the 5f series), in which the lanthanides formed the 4f series This facilitated chemical identification of americium and curium,[112] and further experiments corroborated Seaborg's hypothesis; a spectroscopic study at the Los Alamos National Laboratory by a group led by American physicist Edwin McMillan indicated that 5f orbitals, rather than 6d orbitals, were indeed being filled However, these studies could not unambiguously determine the first element with 5f electrons and therefore the first element in the actinide series;[111] it was thus also referred to as the \\\"thoride\\\" or \\\"uranide\\\" series until it was later found that the series began with actinium[110][113] In light of these observations and an apparent explanation for the chemistry of transuranic elements, and despite fear among his colleagues that it was a radical idea that would ruin his reputation, Seaborg nevertheless submitted it to Chemical & Engineering News and it gained widespread acceptance; new periodic tables thus placed the actinides below the lanthanides[112] Following its acceptance, the actinide concept proved pivotal in the groundwork for discoveries of heavier elements, such as berkelium in 1949[114] It also supported experimental results for a trend towards +3 oxidation states in the elements beyond americium‚Äîa trend observed in the analogous 4f series[110] Relativistic effects and expansions beyond period 7[edit] Seaborg's subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of superheavy elements in a transactinide series comprising elements from 104 to 121 and a superactinide series of elements from 122 to 153[111] He proposed an extended periodic table with an additional period of 50 elements (thus reaching element 168); this eighth period was derived from an extrapolation of the Aufbau principle and placed elements 121 to 138 in a g-block, in which a new g subshell would be filled[115] Seaborg's model, however, did not take into account relativistic effects resulting from high atomic number and electron orbital speed Burkhard Fricke in 1971[116] and Pekka Pyykk√∂ in 2010[117] used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to Z = 172, and found that the positions of several elements were different from those predicted by Seaborg Although models from Pyykk√∂ and Fricke generally place element 172 as the next noble gas, there is no clear consensus on the electron configurations of elements beyond 120 and thus their placement in an extended periodic table It is now thought that because of relativistic effects, such an extension will feature elements that break the periodicity in known elements, thus posing another hurdle to future periodic table constructs[117] The discovery of tennessine in 2010 filled the last remaining gap in the seventh period Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period Despite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at University of California, Berkeley observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and between dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups 4 and 5 More recent experiments on copernicium and flerovium have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas radon rather than mercury and lead, their respective congeners As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements[2][118] See also[edit] History of chemistry Periodic systems of small molecules The Mystery of Matter: Search for the Elements (PBS film) Discovery of chemical elements Types of periodic tables Notes[edit] ^ They were R2O, R2O2, R2O3, R2O4, R2O5, R2O6, and R2O7 The list was later appended with R2O8 ^ Scerri notes that this table \\\"does not include elements such as astatine and actinium, which he [Mendeleev] predicted successfully but did not name Neither does it include predictions that were represented just by dashes in Mendeleev‚Äôs periodic systems Among some other failures, not included in the table, is an inert gas element between barium and tantalum, which would have been called ekaxenon, although Mendeleev did not refer to it as such\\\"[38] ^ He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, such as the halogens and the alkali metals) Other primary groups were rhodium, ruthenium, and palladium; and iridium, osmium, and platinum ^ Mendeleev referred to Brauner in this manner after Brauner measured the atomic weight of tellurium and obtained the value 125 Mendeleev had thought that due to the properties tellurium and iodine display, the latter should be the heavier one while the contemporary data pointed otherwise (tellurium was assessed with the value of 128, and iodine 127) Later measurements by Brauner himself, however, showed the correctness of the original measurement; Mendeleev doubted it for the rest of his life[46] ^ Notably, Mendeleev did not immediately identify germanium as eka-silicium Winkler explained, \\\"The present case, however, shows quite clearly how deceptive it can be to use analogies, because the tetradic value of germanium has meanwhile become an irrefutable fact, and there can be no doubt that the new element is nothing other than \\\"eka-silicium\\\" predicted by Mendeleev fifteen years ago This identification comes from the short and still very imperfect characteristic of germanium that I gave at the beginning and was first decisively pronounced by V v Richter Almost at the same time, Mendeleev, the deserving creator of the periodic system, commented that although several of the properties of germanium I mentioned reminded of those of eka-silicium, the observed liquidity of the element indicated the possibility of placing it elsewhere in the periodic system Lothar Meyer declared the germanium to be eka-silicium from the beginning, adding that according to the atomic volume curve produced by it, contrary to Mendeleev's assumption, it had to be easily meltable and probably also easy to vaporize At that time the germanium had not yet been presented in the reguline state; it is all the more remarkable that, as will be shown below, Lothar Meyer's condition has, to some extent, really come true\\\"[55] ^ Meyer's tables, in contrast, did not at all attempt to incorporate those elements[citation needed] ^ The only other monatomic gas known at the time was vaporized mercury[63] ^ Mendeleev did consider that some atomic weight values could be missing from the set of known values However, Mendeleev could not have made a prediction of a group of unreactive gases in a fashion similar to the one in which he made his predictions on reactive elements and their chemical properties[74] ^ The notion of ether was disproven by German physicist Albert Einstein in 1905 with his special theory of relativity; the idea that ether did not exist was accepted in the scientific community rather quickly References[edit] ^ IUPAC article on periodic table Archived 2008-02-13 at the Wayback Machine ^ a b Roberts, Siobhan (27

elements, is an ordered arrangement of the chemical elements into rows (\\\"periods\\\") and columns (\\\"groups\\\") It is an icon of chemistry and is widely used in physics and other sciences It is a depiction of the periodic law, which states that when the elements are arranged in order of their atomic numbers an approximate recurrence of their properties is evident The table is divided into four roughly rectangular areas called blocks Elements in the same group tend to show similar chemical characteristics Vertical, horizontal and diagonal trends characterize the periodic table Metallic character increases going down a group and from right to left across a period Nonmetallic character increases going from the bottom left of the periodic table to the top right The first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869; he formulated the periodic law as a dependence of chemical properties on atomic mass As not all elements were then known, there were gaps in his periodic table, and Mendeleev successfully used the periodic law to predict some properties of some of the missing elements The periodic law was recognized as a fundamental discovery in the late 19th century It was explained early in the 20th century, with the discovery of atomic numbers and associated pioneering work in quantum mechanics, both ideas serving to illuminate the internal structure of the atom A recognisably modern form of the table was reached in 1945 with Glenn T Seaborg's discovery that the actinides were in fact f-block rather than d-block elements The periodic table and law are now a central and indispensable part of modern chemistry The periodic table continues to evolve with the progress of science In nature, only elements up to atomic number 94 exist;[a] to go further, it was necessary to synthesize new elements in the laboratory By 2010, the first 118 elements were known, thereby completing the first seven rows of the table;[1] however, chemical characterization is still needed for the heaviest elements to confirm that their properties match their positions New discoveries will extend the table beyond these seven rows, though it is not yet known how many more elements are possible; moreover, theoretical calculations suggest that this unknown region will not follow the patterns of the known part of the table Some scientific discussion also continues regarding whether some elements are correctly positioned in today's table Many alternative representations of the periodic law exist, and there is some discussion as to whether there is an optimal form of the periodic table Structure vtePeriodic table Group 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Hydrogen &alkali metals Alkaline earth metals

(g orbitals and higher are not shown) Each chemical element has a unique atomic number (Z‚Äî for \\\"Zahl\\\", German for \\\"number\\\") representing the number of protons in its nucleus[4] Each distinct atomic number therefore corresponds to a class of atom: these classes are called the chemical elements[5] The chemical elements are what the periodic table classifies and organizes Hydrogen is the element with atomic number 1; helium, atomic number 2; lithium, atomic number 3; and so on Each of these names can be further abbreviated by a one- or two-letter chemical symbol; those for hydrogen, helium, and lithium are respectively H, He, and Li[6] Neutrons do not affect the atom's chemical identity, but do affect its weight Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes of the same chemical element[6] Naturally occurring elements usually occur as mixes of different isotopes; since each isotope usually occurs with a characteristic abundance, naturally occurring elements have well-defined atomic weights, defined as the average mass of a naturally occurring atom of that element[7] All elements have multiple isotopes, variants with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element When atomic mass is shown, it is usually the weighted average of naturally occurring isotopes; but if no isotopes occur naturally in significant quantities, the mass of the most stable isotope usually appears, often in parentheses[8] In the standard periodic table, the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron Columns (groups) are determined by the electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (eg oxygen, sulfur, and selenium are in the same column because they all have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell) Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it[9] Today, 118 elements are known, the first 94 of which are known to occur naturally on Earth at present[10][a] The remaining 24, americium to oganesson (95‚Äì118), occur only when synthesized in laboratories Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements A few of the latter are so rare that they were not discovered in nature, but were synthesized in the laboratory before it was determined that they do exist in nature after all: technetium (element 43), promethium (element 61), astatine (element 85), neptunium (element 93), and plutonium (element 94)[12] No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) has ever been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine; francium (element 87) has been only photographed in the form of light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms)[14] Of the 94 natural elements, eighty have a stable isotope and one more (bismuth) has an almost-stable isotope (with a half-life of 201√ó1019 years, over a billion times the age of the universe)[15][b] Two more, thorium and uranium, have isotopes undergoing radioactive decay with a half-life comparable to the age of the Earth The stable elements plus bismuth, thorium, and uranium make up the 83 primordial elements that survived from the Earth's formation[c] The remaining eleven natural elements decay quickly enough that their continued trace occurrence rests primarily on being constantly regenerated as intermediate products of the decay of thorium and uranium[d] All 24 known artificial elements are radioactive[6] Group names and numbers Under an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases) The f-block groups are ignored in this numbering[22] Groups can also be named by their first element, eg the \\\"scandium group\\\" for group 3[22] Previously, groups were known by Roman numerals In the United States, the Roman numerals were followed by either an \\\"A\\\" if the group was in the s- or p-block, or a \\\"B\\\" if the group was in the d-block The Roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (eg the group 4 elements were group IVB, and the group 14 elements were group IVA) In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that \\\"A\\\" was used for groups 1 through 7, and \\\"B\\\" was used for groups 11 through 17 In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII In 1988, the new IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) naming system (1‚Äì18) was put into use, and the old group names (I‚ÄìVIII) were deprecated[23] vteGroups in the periodic table IUPAC group 1a 2 ‚Äîb 3c 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Mendeleev

Mc Lv Ts Og a Group 1 is composed of hydrogen (H) and the alkali metals Elements of the group have one s-electron in the outer electron shell Hydrogen is not considered to be an alkali metal as it is not a metal, though it is more analogous to them than any other group This makes the group somewhat exceptionalb The 14 f-block groups (columns) do not have a group numberc The correct composition of group 3 is scandium (Sc), yttrium (Y), lutetium (Lu), and lawrencium (Lr), as shown here: this is endorsed by 1988[23] and 2021[24] IUPAC reports on the question General inorganic chemistry texts often put scandium (Sc), yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), and actinium (Ac) in group 3, so that Ce‚ÄìLu and Th‚ÄìLr become the f-block between groups 3 and 4; this was based on incorrectly measured electron configurations from history,[25] and Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz already considered it incorrect in 1948[26] Arguments can still occasionally be encountered in the contemporary literature purporting to defend it, but most authors consider them logically inconsistent[27][28][29] Some sources follow a compromise that puts La‚ÄìLu and Ac‚ÄìLr as the f-block rows (despite that giving 15 f-block elements in each row, which contradicts quantum mechanics), leaving the heavier members of group 3 ambiguous[24] See also Group 3 element#Compositiond Group 18, the noble gases, were not

main body[32][30][23] This reduces the number of element columns from 32 to 18[30] Both forms represent the same periodic table[6] The form with the f-block included in the main body is sometimes called the 32-column[6] or long form;[33] the form with the f-block cut out the 18-column[6] or medium-long form[33] The 32-column form has the advantage of showing all elements in their correct sequence, but it has the disadvantage of requiring more space[34] The form chosen is an editorial choice, and does not imply any change of scientific claim or statement For example, when discussing the composition of group 3, the options can be shown equally (unprejudiced) in both forms[35] Periodic tables usually at least show the elements' symbols; many also provide supplementary information about the elements, either via colour-coding or as data in the cells The above table shows the names and atomic numbers of the elements, and also their blocks, natural occurrences and standard atomic weights For the short-lived elements without standard atomic weights, the mass number of the most stable known isotope is used instead Other tables may include properties such as state of matter, melting and boiling points, densities, as well as provide different classifications of the elements[e] Electron configurations Main article: Electron configuration The periodic table is a graphic description of the periodic law,[36] which states that the properties and atomic structures of the chemical elements are a periodic function of their atomic number[37] Elements are placed in the periodic table according to their electron configurations,[38] the periodic recurrences of which explain the trends in properties across the periodic table[39] An electron can be thought of as inhabiting an atomic orbital, which characterizes the probability it can be found in any particular region around the atom Their energies are quantised, which is to say that they can only take discrete values Furthermore, electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle: different electrons must always be in different states This allows classification of the possible states an electron can take in various energy levels known as shells, divided into individual subshells, which each contain one or more orbitals Each orbital can contain up to two electrons: they are distinguished by a quantity known as spin, conventionally labelled \\\"up\\\" or \\\"down\\\"[40][f] In a cold atom (one in its ground state), electrons arrange themselves in such a way that the total energy they have is minimized by occupying the lowest-energy orbitals available[42] Only the outermost electrons (so-called valence electrons) have enough energy to break free of the nucleus and participate in chemical reactions with other atoms The others are called core electrons[43] ‚Ñì = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Shell capacity (2n2)[44] Orbital s p d f g h i n = 1 1s 2 n = 2 2s 2p 8 n = 3 3s 3p 3d 18 n = 4 4s 4p 4d 4f 32 n

shell contains only one orbital, a spherical s orbital As it is in the first shell, this is called the 1s orbital This can hold up to two electrons The second shell similarly contains a 2s orbital, and it also contains three dumbbell-shaped 2p orbitals, and can thus fill up to eight electrons (2√ó1 + 2√ó3 = 8) The third shell contains one 3s orbital, three 3p orbitals, and five 3d orbitals, and thus has a capacity of 2√ó1 + 2√ó3 + 2√ó5 = 18 The fourth shell contains one 4s orbital, three 4p orbitals, five 4d orbitals, and seven 4f orbitals, thus leading to a capacity of 2√ó1 + 2√ó3 + 2√ó5 + 2√ó7 = 32[30] Higher shells contain more types of orbitals that continue the pattern, but such types of orbitals are not filled in the ground states of known elements[45] The subshell types are characterized by the quantum numbers Four numbers describe an orbital in an atom completely: the principal quantum number n, the azimuthal quantum number ‚Ñì (the orbital type), the orbital magnetic quantum number m‚Ñì, and the spin magnetic quantum number ms[39] Order of subshell filling Idealized order of subshell filling according to the Madelung rule The sequence in which the subshells are filled is given in most cases by the Aufbau principle, also known as the Madelung or Klechkovsky rule (after Erwin Madelung and Vsevolod Klechkovsky respectively) This rule was first observed empirically by Madelung, and Klechkovsky and later authors gave it theoretical justification[46][47][48][49][g] The shells overlap in energies, and the Madelung rule specifies the sequence of filling according to:[47] 1s ‚â™ 2s < 2p ‚â™ 3s < 3p ‚â™ 4s < 3d < 4p ‚â™ 5s < 4d < 5p ‚â™ 6s < 4f < 5d < 6p ‚â™ 7s < 5f < 6d < 7p ‚â™ Here the sign ‚â™ means \\\"much less than\\\" as opposed to < meaning just \\\"less than\\\"[47] Phrased differently, electrons enter orbitals in order of increasing n + ‚Ñì, and if two orbitals are available with the same value of n + ‚Ñì, the one with lower n is occupied first[45][49] In general, orbitals with the same value of n + ‚Ñì are similar in energy, but in the case of the s-orbitals (with ‚Ñì = 0), quantum effects raise their energy to approach that of the next n + ‚Ñì group Hence the periodic table is usually drawn to begin each row (often called a period) with the filling of a new s-orbital, which corresponds to the beginning of a new shell[47][48][30] Thus, with the exception of the first row, each period length appears twice:[47] 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, 32, The overlaps get quite close at the point where the d-orbitals enter the picture,[50] and the order can shift slightly with atomic number[51] and atomic charge[52][h] Starting from the simplest atom, this lets us build up the periodic table one at a time in order of atomic number, by considering the cases of single atoms In hydrogen, there is only one electron, which must go in the lowest-energy orbital 1s This electron configuration is written 1s1, where the superscript indicates the number of electrons in the subshell Helium adds a second electron, which also goes into 1s, completely filling the first shell and giving the configuration 1s2[39][58][i] Starting from the third element, lithium, the first shell is full, so its third electron occupies a 2s orbital, giving a 1s2 2s1 configuration The 2s electron is lithium's only valence electron, as the 1s subshell is now too tightly bound to the nucleus to participate in chemical bonding to other atoms: such a shell is called a \\\"core shell\\\" The 1s subshell is a core shell for all elements from lithium onward The 2s subshell is completed by the next element beryllium (1s2 2s2) The following elements then proceed to fill the 2p subshell Boron (1s2 2s2 2p1) puts its new electron in a 2p orbital; carbon (1s2 2s2 2p2) fills a second 2p orbital; and with nitrogen (1s2 2s2 2p3) all three 2p orbitals become singly occupied This is consistent with Hund's rule, which states that atoms usually prefer to singly occupy each orbital of the same type before filling them with the second electron Oxygen (1s2 2s2 2p4), fluorine (1s2 2s2 2p5), and neon (1s2 2s2 2p6) then complete the already singly filled 2p orbitals; the last of these fills the second shell completely[39][58] Starting from element 11, sodium, the second shell is full, making the second shell a core shell for this and all heavier elements The eleventh electron begins the filling of the third shell by occupying a 3s orbital, giving a configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1 for sodium This configuration is abbreviated [Ne] 3s1, where [Ne] represents neon's configuration Magnesium ([Ne] 3s2) finishes this 3s orbital, and the following six elements aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and argon fill the three 3p orbitals ([Ne] 3s2 3p1 through [Ne] 3s2 3p6)[39][58] This creates an analogous series in which the outer shell structures of sodium through argon are analogous to those of lithium through neon, and is the basis for the periodicity of chemical properties that the periodic table illustrates:[39] at regular but changing intervals of atomic numbers, the properties of the chemical elements approximately repeat[36] The first eighteen elements can thus be arranged as the start of a periodic table Elements in the same column have the same number of valence electrons and have analogous valence electron configurations: these columns are called groups The single exception is helium, which has two valence electrons like beryllium and magnesium, but is typically placed in the column of neon and argon to emphasise that its outer shell is full (Some contemporary authors question even this single exception, preferring to consistently follow the valence configurations and place helium over beryllium) There are eight columns in this periodic table fragment, corresponding to at most eight outer-shell electrons[32] A period begins when a new shell starts filling[30] Finally, the colouring illustrates the blocks: the elements in the s-block (coloured red) are filling s-orbitals, while those in the p-block (coloured yellow) are filling p-orbitals[30] 1H 2He 2√ó1 = 2 elements1s

lowest in energy, and therefore they fill it[39][58] Potassium adds one electron to the 4s shell ([Ar] 4s1), and calcium then completes it ([Ar] 4s2) However, starting from scandium ([Ar] 3d1 4s2) the 3d subshell becomes the next highest in energy The 4s and 3d subshells have approximately the same energy and they compete for filling the electrons, and so the occupation is not quite consistently filling the 3d orbitals one at a time The precise energy ordering of 3d and 4s changes along the row, and also changes depending on how many electrons are removed from the atom For example, due to the repulsion between the 3d electrons and the 4s ones, at chromium the 4s energy level becomes slightly higher than 3d, and so it becomes more profitable for a chromium atom to have a [Ar] 3d5 4s1 configuration than an [Ar] 3d4 4s2 one A similar anomaly occurs at copper, whose atom has a [Ar] 3d10 4s1 configuration rather than the expected [Ar] 3d9 4s2[39] These are violations of the Madelung rule Such anomalies, however, do not have any chemical significance:[52] most chemistry is not about isolated gaseous atoms,[60] and the various configurations are so close in energy to each other[50] that the presence of a nearby atom can shift the balance[39] Therefore, the periodic table ignores them and considers only idealized configurations[38] At zinc ([Ar] 3d10 4s2), the 3d orbitals are completely filled with a total of ten electrons[39][58] Next come the 4p orbitals, completing the row, which are filled progressively by gallium ([Ar] 3d10 4s2 4p1) through krypton ([Ar] 3d10 4s2 4p6), in a manner analogous to the previous p-block elements[39][58] From gallium onwards, the 3d orbitals form part of the electronic core, and no longer participate in chemistry[57] The s- and p-block elements, which fill their outer shells, are called main-group elements; the d-block elements (coloured blue below), which fill an inner shell, are called transition elements (or transition metals, since they are all metals)[61] The next eighteen elements fill the 5s orbitals (rubidium and strontium), then 4d (yttrium through cadmium, again with a few anomalies along the way), and then 5p (indium through xenon)[30][58] Again, from indium onward the 4d orbitals are in the core[58][62] Hence the fifth row has the same structure as the fourth[30] 1H 2He 2√ó1 = 2 elements1s 0d 0p 3Li

starts with two s-block elements: caesium and barium[58] After this, the first f-block elements (coloured green below) begin to appear, starting with lanthanum These are sometimes termed inner transition elements[61] As there are now not only 4f but also 5d and 6s subshells at similar energies, competition occurs once again with many irregular configurations;[50] this resulted in some dispute about where exactly the f-block is supposed to begin, but most who study the matter agree that it starts at lanthanum in accordance with the Aufbau principle[27] Even though lanthanum does not itself fill the 4f subshell as a single atom, because of repulsion between electrons,[52] its 4f orbitals are low enough in energy to participate in chemistry[63][53][64] At ytterbium, the seven 4f orbitals are completely filled with fourteen electrons; thereafter, a series of ten transition elements (lutetium through mercury) follows,[58][65][66][67] and finally six main-group elements (thallium through radon) complete the period[58][68] From lutetium onwards the 4f orbitals are in the core,[58][64] and from thallium onwards so are the 5d orbitals[58][57][69] The seventh row is analogous to the sixth row: 7s fills (francium and radium), then 5f (actinium to nobelium), then 6d (lawrencium to copernicium), and finally 7p (nihonium to oganesson)[58] Starting from lawrencium the 5f orbitals are in the core,[58] and probably the 6d orbitals join the core starting from nihonium[58][70][j] Again there are a few anomalies along the way:[30] for example, as single atoms neither actinium nor thorium actually fills the 5f subshell, and lawrencium does not fill the 6d shell, but all these subshells can still become filled in chemical environments[72][73][74] For a very long time, the seventh row was incomplete as most of its elements do not occur in nature The missing elements beyond uranium started to be synthesized in the laboratory in 1940, when neptunium was made[75] (However, the first element to be discovered by synthesis rather than in nature was technetium in 1937) The row was completed with the synthesis of tennessine in 2010[76] (the last element oganesson had already been made in 2002),[77] and the last elements in this seventh row were given names in 2016[78] 1H 2He 2√ó1 = 2 elements1s 0f 0d 0p 3Li 4Be 5B 6C 7N 8O 9F 10Ne 2√ó(1+3) = 8 elements2s 0f 0d

118Og214106 s-block f-block d-block p-block Variations Period 1 Main article: Period 1 element Although the modern periodic table is standard today, the placement of the period 1 elements hydrogen and helium remains an open issue under discussion, and some variation can be found[57][81] Following their respective s1 and s2 electron configurations, hydrogen would be placed in group 1, and helium would be placed in group 2[57] The group 1 placement of hydrogen is common, but helium is almost always placed in group 18 with the other noble gases[6] The debate has to do with conflicting understandings of the extent to which chemical or electronic properties should decide periodic table placement[81] Like the group 1 metals, hydrogen has one electron in its outermost shell[82] and typically loses its only electron in chemical reactions[83] Hydrogen has some metal-like chemical properties, being able to displace some metals from their salts[83] But it forms a diatomic nonmetallic gas at standard conditions, unlike the alkali metals which are reactive solid metals This and hydrogen's formation of hydrides, in which it gains an electron, brings it close to the properties of the halogens which do the same[83] (though it is rarer for hydrogen to form H‚àí than H+)[84] Moreover, the lightest two halogens (fluorine and chlorine) are gaseous like hydrogen at standard conditions[83] Some properties of hydrogen are not a good fit for either group: hydrogen is neither highly oxidizing nor highly reducing and is not reactive with water[84] Hydrogen thus has properties corresponding to both those of the alkali metals and the halogens, but matches neither group perfectly, and is thus difficult to place by its chemistry[83] Therefore, while the electronic placement of hydrogen in group 1 predominates, some rarer arrangements show either hydrogen in group 17,[85] duplicate hydrogen in both groups 1 and 17,[86][87] or float it separately from all groups[87][88][57] This last option has nonetheless been criticized by the chemist and philosopher of science Eric Scerri on the grounds that it appears to imply that hydrogen is above the periodic law altogether, unlike all the other elements[89] Helium is the only element that routinely occupies a position in the periodic table that is not consistent with its electronic structure It has two electrons in its outermost shell, whereas the other noble gases have eight; and it is an s-block element, whereas all other noble gases are p-block elements However it is unreactive at standard conditions, and has a full outer shell: these properties are like the noble gases in group 18, but not at all like the reactive alkaline earth metals of group 2 For these reasons helium is nearly universally placed in group 18[6] which its properties best match;[57] a proposal to move helium to group 2 was rejected by IUPAC in 1988 for these reasons[23] Nonetheless, helium is still occasionally placed in group 2 today,[90] and some of its physical and chemical properties are closer to the group 2 elements and support the electronic placement[82][57] Solid helium crystallises in a hexagonal close-packed structure, which matches beryllium and magnesium in group 2, but not the other noble gases in group 18[91] Recent theoretical developments in noble gas chemistry, in which helium is expected to show slightly less inertness than neon and to form (HeO)(LiF)2 with a structure similar to the analogous beryllium compound (but with no expected neon analogue), have resulted in more chemists advocating a placement of helium in group 2 This relates to the electronic argument, as the reason for neon's greater inertness is repulsion from its filled p-shell that helium lacks, though realistically it is unlikely that helium-containing molecules will be stable outside extreme low-temperature conditions (around 10 K)[92][93][94][95] The first-row anomaly in the periodic table has additionally been cited to support moving helium to group 2 It arises because the first orbital of any type is unusually small, since unlike its higher analogues, it does not experience interelectronic repulsion from a smaller orbital of the same type This makes the first row of elements in each block unusually small, and such elements tend to exhibit characteristic kinds of anomalies for their group Some chemists arguing for the repositioning of helium have pointed out that helium exhibits these anomalies if it is placed in group 2, but not if it is placed in group 18: on the other hand, neon, which would be the first group 18 element if helium was removed from that spot, does exhibit those anomalies[92] The relationship between helium and beryllium is then argued to resemble that between hydrogen and lithium, a placement which is much more commonly accepted[93] For example, because of this trend in the sizes of orbitals, a large difference in atomic radii between the first and second members of each main group is seen in groups 1 and 13‚Äì17: it exists between neon and argon, and between helium and beryllium, but not between helium and neon This similarly affects the noble gases' boiling points and solubilities in water, where helium is too close to neon, and the large difference characteristic between the first two elements of a group appears only between neon and argon Moving helium to group 2 makes this trend consistent in groups 2 and 18 as well, by making helium the first group 2 element and neon the first group 18 element: both exhibit the characteristic properties of a kainosymmetric first element of a group[96][97] The group 18 placement of helium nonetheless remains near-universal due to its extreme inertness[98] Additionally, tables that float both hydrogen and helium outside all groups may rarely be encountered[88][57][58] Group 3 Main article: Group 3 element ¬ß Composition Group 3: Sc, Y, Lu, Lr Hydrogen

In many periodic tables, the f-block is shifted one element to the right, so that lanthanum and actinium become d-block elements in group 3, and Ce‚ÄìLu and Th‚ÄìLr form the f-block Thus the d-block is split into two very uneven portions This is a holdover from early mistaken measurements of electron configurations; modern measurements are more consistent with the form with lutetium and lawrencium in group 3, and with La‚ÄìYb and Ac‚ÄìNo as the f-block[25][99] The 4f shell is completely filled at ytterbium, and for that reason Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz in 1948 considered it incorrect to group lutetium as an f-block element[26] They did not yet take the step of removing lanthanum from the d-block as well, but Jun Kond≈ç realized in 1963 that lanthanum's low-temperature superconductivity implied the activity of its 4f shell[100] In 1965, David C Hamilton linked this observation to its position in the periodic table, and argued that the f-block should be composed of the elements La‚ÄìYb and Ac‚ÄìNo[63] Since then, physical, chemical, and electronic evidence has supported this assignment[25][23][99] The issue was brought to wide attention by William B Jensen in 1982,[25] and the reassignment of lutetium and lawrencium to group 3 was supported by IUPAC reports dating from 1988 (when the 1‚Äì18 group numbers were recommended)[23] and 2021[24] The variation nonetheless still exists because most textbook writers are not aware of the issue[25] A third form can sometimes be encountered in which the spaces below yttrium in group 3 are left empty, such as the table appearing on the IUPAC web site,[6] but this creates an inconsistency with quantum mechanics by making the f-block 15 elements wide (La‚ÄìLu and Ac‚ÄìLr) even though only 14 electrons can fit in an f-subshell[24] There is moreover some confusion in the literature on which elements are then implied to be in group 3[24][33][101][102][103] While the 2021 IUPAC report noted that 15-element-wide f-blocks are supported by some practitioners of a specialized branch of relativistic quantum mechanics focusing on the properties of superheavy elements, the project's opinion was that such interest-dependent concerns should not have any bearing on how the periodic table is presented to \\\"the general chemical and scientific community\\\"[24] Other authors focusing on superheavy elements since clarified that the \\\"15th entry of the f-block represents the first slot of the d-block which is left vacant to indicate the place of the f-block inserts\\\", which would imply that this form still has lutetium and lawrencium (the 15th entries in question) as d-block elements in group 3[104] Indeed, when IUPAC publications expand the table to 32 columns, they make this clear and place lutetium and lawrencium under yttrium in group 3[105][106] Several arguments in favour of Sc-Y-La-Ac can be encountered in the literature,[107][108] but they have been challenged as being logically inconsistent[27][28][29] For example, it has been argued that lanthanum and actinium cannot be f-block elements because as individual gas-phase atoms, they have not begun to fill the f-subshells[109] But the same is true of thorium which is never disputed as an f-block element,[24][25] and this argument overlooks the problem on the other end: that the f-shells complete filling at ytterbium and nobelium, matching the Sc-Y-Lu-Lr form, and not at lutetium and lawrencium as the Sc-Y-La-Ac form would have it[110] Not only are such exceptional configurations in the minority,[110] but they have also in any case never been considered as relevant for positioning any other elements on the periodic table: in gaseous atoms, the d-shells complete their filling at copper, palladium, and gold, but it is universally accepted by chemists that these configurations are exceptional and that the d-block really ends in accordance with the Madelung rule at zinc, cadmium, and mercury[33] The relevant fact for placement[38][65] is that lanthanum and actinium (like thorium) have valence f-orbitals that can become occupied in chemical environments, whereas lutetium and lawrencium do not:[58][111][74] their f-shells are in the core, and cannot be used for chemical reactions[64][112] Thus the relationship between yttrium and lanthanum is only a secondary relationship between elements with the same number of valence electrons but different kinds of valence orbitals, such as that between chromium and uranium; whereas the relationship between yttrium and lutetium is primary, sharing both valence electron count and valence orbital type[58] Periodic trends Main article: Periodic trends As chemical reactions involve the valence electrons,[32] elements with similar outer electron configurations may be expected to react similarly and form compounds with similar proportions of elements in them[113] Such elements are placed in the same group, and thus there tend to be clear similarities and trends in chemical behaviour as one proceeds down a group[114] As analogous configurations occur at regular intervals, the properties of the elements thus exhibit periodic recurrences, hence the name of the periodic table and the periodic law These periodic recurrences were noticed well before the underlying theory that explains them was developed[115][116] Atomic radius Historically, the physical size of atoms was unknown until the early 20th century The first calculated estimate of the atomic radius of hydrogen was published by physicist Arthur Haas in 1910 to within an order of magnitude (a factor of 10) of the accepted value, the Bohr radius (~0529 √Ö) In his model, Haas used a single-electron configuration based on the classical atomic model proposed by J J Thomson in 1904, often called the plum-pudding model[117] Atomic radii (the size of atoms) are dependent on the sizes of their outermost orbitals[96] They generally decrease going left to right along the main-group elements, because the nuclear charge increases but the outer electrons are still in the same shell However, going down a column, the radii generally increase, because the outermost electrons are in higher shells that are thus further away from the nucleus[32][118] The first row of each block is abnormally small, due to an effect called kainosymmetry or primogenic repulsion:[119] the 1s, 2p, 3d, and 4f subshells have no inner analogues For example, the 2p orbitals do not experience strong repulsion from the 1s and 2s orbitals, which have quite different angular charge distributions, and hence are not very large; but the 3p orbitals experience strong repulsion from the 2p orbitals, which have similar angular charge distributions Thus higher s-, p-, d-, and f-subshells experience strong repulsion from their inner analogues, which have approximately the same angular distribution of charge, and must expand to avoid this This makes significant differences arise between the small 2p elements, which prefer multiple bonding, and the larger 3p and higher p-elements, which do not[96] Similar anomalies arise for the 1s, 2p, 3d, 4f, and the hypothetical 5g elements:[120] the degree of this first-row anomaly is highest for the s-block, is moderate for the p-block, and is less pronounced for the d- and f-blocks[121] In the transition elements, an inner shell is filling, but the size of the atom is still determined by the outer electrons The increasing nuclear charge across the series and the increased number of inner electrons for shielding somewhat compensate each other, so the decrease in radius is smaller[118] The 4p and 5d atoms, coming immediately after new types of transition series are first introduced, are smaller than would have been expected,[122] because the added core 3d and 4f subshells provide only incomplete shielding of the nuclear charge for the outer electrons Hence for example gallium atoms are slightly smaller than aluminium atoms[96] Together with kainosymmetry, this results in an even-odd difference between the periods (except in the s-block)[k] that is sometimes known as secondary periodicity: elements in even periods have smaller atomic radii and prefer to lose fewer electrons, while elements in odd periods (except the first) differ in the opposite direction Thus for example many properties in the p-block show a zigzag rather than a smooth trend along the group For example, phosphorus and antimony in odd periods of group 15 readily reach the +5 oxidation state, whereas nitrogen, arsenic, and bismuth in even periods prefer to stay at +3[121][123] A similar situation holds for the d-block, with lutetium through tungsten atoms being slightly smaller than yttrium through molybdenum atoms respectively[124][125] Liquid mercury Its liquid state at standard conditions is the result of relativistic effects[126] Thallium and lead atoms are about the same size as indium and tin atoms respectively, but from bismuth to radon the 6p atoms are larger than the analogous 5p atoms This happens because when atomic nuclei become highly charged, special relativity becomes needed to gauge the effect of the nucleus on the electron cloud These relativistic effects result in heavy elements increasingly having differing properties compared to their lighter homologues in the periodic table Spin‚Äìorbit interaction splits the p-subshell: one p-orbital is relativistically stabilized and shrunken (it fills in thallium and lead), but the other two (filling in bismuth through radon) are relativistically destabilized and expanded[96] Relativistic effects also explain why gold is golden and mercury is a liquid at room temperature[126][127] They are expected to become very strong in the late seventh period, potentially leading to a collapse of periodicity[128] Electron configurations are only clearly known until element 108 (hassium), and experimental chemistry beyond 108 has only been done for elements 112 (copernicium) through 115 (moscovium), so the chemical characterization of the heaviest elements remains a topic of current research[129][130] The trend that atomic radii decrease from left to right is also present in ionic radii, though it is more difficult to examine because the most common ions of consecutive elements normally differ in charge Ions with the same electron configuration decrease in size as their atomic number rises, due to increased attraction from the more positively charged nucleus: thus for example ionic radii decrease in the series Se2‚àí, Br‚àí, Rb+, Sr2+, Y3+, Zr4+, Nb5+, Mo6+, Tc7+ Ions of the same element get smaller as more electrons are removed, because the attraction from the nucleus begins to outweigh the repulsion between electrons that causes electron clouds to expand: thus for example ionic radii decrease in the series V2+, V3+, V4+, V5+[131] Ionisation energy Graph of first ionisation energies of the elements in electronvolts (predictions used for elements 109‚Äì118) The first ionisation energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from it This varies with the atomic radius: ionisation energy increases left to right and down to up, because electrons that are closer to the nucleus are held more tightly and are more difficult to remove Ionisation energy thus is minimized at the first element of each period ‚Äì hydrogen and the alkali metals ‚Äì and then generally rises until it reaches the noble gas at the right edge of the period[32] There are some exceptions to this trend, such as oxygen, where the electron being removed is paired and thus interelectronic repulsion makes it easier to remove than expected[132] In the transition series, the outer electrons are preferentially lost even though the inner orbitals are filling For example, in the 3d series, the 4s electrons are lost first even though the 3d orbitals are being filled The shielding effect of adding an extra 3d electron approximately compensates the rise in nuclear charge, and therefore the ionisation energies stay mostly constant, though there is a small increase especially at the end of each transition series[133] As metal atoms tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions, ionisation energy is generally correlated with chemical reactivity, although there are other factors involved as well[133] Electron affinity Trend in electron affinities The opposite property to ionisation energy is the electron affinity, which is the energy released when adding an electron to the atom[134] A passing electron will be more readily attracted to an atom if it feels the pull of the nucleus more strongly, and especially if there is an available partially filled outer orbital that can accommodate it Therefore, electron affinity tends to increase down to up and left to right The exception is the last column, the noble gases, which have a full shell and have no room for another electron This gives the halogens in the next-to-last column the highest electron affinities[32] Some atoms, like the noble gases, have no electron affinity: they cannot form stable gas-phase anions[135] (They can form metastable resonances if the incoming electron arrives with enough kinetic energy, but these inevitably and rapidly autodetach: for example, the lifetime of the most long-lived He‚àí level is about 359 microseconds)[136] The noble gases, having high ionisation energies and no electron affinity, have little inclination towards gaining or losing electrons and are generally unreactive[32] Some exceptions to the trends occur: oxygen and fluorine have lower electron affinities than their heavier homologues sulfur and chlorine, because they are small atoms and hence the newly added electron would experience significant repulsion from the already present ones For the nonmetallic elements, electron affinity likewise somewhat correlates with reactivity, but not perfectly since other factors are involved For example, fluorine has a lower electron affinity than chlorine (because of extreme interelectronic repulsion for the very small fluorine atom), but is more reactive[134] Valence and oxidation states Lead(II) oxide (PbO, left) and lead(IV) oxide (PbO2, right), the two stable oxides of lead The valence of an element can be defined either as the number of hydrogen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary hydride, or as twice the number of oxygen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary oxide (that is, not a peroxide or a superoxide)[110] The valences of the main-group elements are directly related to the group number: the hydrides in the main groups 1‚Äì2 and 13‚Äì17 follow the formulae MH, MH2, MH3, MH4, MH3, MH2, and finally MH The highest oxides instead increase in valence, following the formulae M2O, MO, M2O3, MO2, M2O5, MO3, M2O7[l] Today the notion of valence has been extended by that of the oxidation state, which is the formal charge left on an element when all other elements in a compound have been removed as their ions[113] The electron configuration suggests a ready explanation from the number of electrons available for bonding;[113] indeed, the number of valence electrons starts at 1 in group 1, and then increases towards the right side of the periodic table, only resetting at 3 whenever each new block starts Thus in period 6, Cs‚ÄìBa have 1‚Äì2 valence electrons; La‚ÄìYb have 3‚Äì16; Lu‚ÄìHg have 3‚Äì12; and Tl‚ÄìRn have 3‚Äì8[112] However, towards the right side of the d- and f-blocks, the theoretical maximum corresponding to using all valence electrons is not achievable at all;[137] the same situation affects oxygen, fluorine, and the light noble gases up to krypton[138] Number of valence electrons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 1 H1 He2 2 Li1 Be2 B3 C4 N5 O6 F7 Ne8 3 Na1 Mg2 Al3 Si4 P5 S6 Cl7 Ar8 4 K1 Ca2 Sc3 Ti4 V5 Cr6 Mn7 Fe8 Co9 Ni10 Cu11 Zn12 Ga3 Ge4 As5 Se6

considering the energy that would be released in forming compounds with different valences rather than simply considering electron configurations alone[139] For example, magnesium forms Mg2+ rather than Mg+ cations when dissolved in water, because the latter would spontaneously disproportionate into Mg0 and Mg2+ cations This is because the enthalpy of hydration (surrounding the cation with water molecules) increases in magnitude with the charge and radius of the ion In Mg+, the outermost orbital (which determines ionic radius) is still 3s, so the hydration enthalpy is small and insufficient to compensate the energy required to remove the electron; but ionizing again to Mg2+ uncovers the core 2p subshell, making the hydration enthalpy large enough to allow magnesium(II) compounds to form For similar reasons, the common oxidation states of the heavier p-block elements (where the ns electrons become lower in energy than the np) tend to vary by steps of 2, because that is necessary to uncover an inner subshell and decrease the ionic radius (eg Tl+ uncovers 6s, and Tl3+ uncovers 5d, so once thallium loses two electrons it tends to lose the third one as well) Analogous arguments based on orbital hybridization can be used for the less electronegative p-block elements[140][m] Oxidation states of the transition metals The solid dots show common oxidation states, and the hollow dots show possible but unlikely states For transition metals, common oxidation states are nearly always at least +2 for similar reasons (uncovering the next subshell); this holds even for the metals with anomalous dx+1s1 or dx+2s0 configurations (except for silver), because repulsion between d-electrons means that the movement of the second electron from the s- to the d-subshell does not appreciably change its ionisation energy[142] Because ionizing the transition metals further does not uncover any new inner subshells, their oxidation states tend to vary by steps of 1 instead[140] The lanthanides and late actinides generally show a stable +3 oxidation state, removing the outer s-electrons and then (usually) one electron from the (n‚àí2)f-orbitals, that are similar in energy to ns[143] The common and maximum oxidation states of the d- and f-block elements tend to depend on the ionisation energies As the energy difference between the (n‚àí1)d and ns orbitals rises along each transition series, it becomes less energetically favourable to ionize further electrons Thus, the early transition metal groups tend to prefer higher oxidation states, but the +2 oxidation state becomes more stable for the late transition metal groups The highest formal oxidation state thus increases from +3 at the beginning of each d-block row, to +7 or +8 in the middle (eg OsO4), and then decrease to +2 at the end[142] The lanthanides and late actinides usually have high fourth ionisation energies and hence rarely surpass the +3 oxidation state, whereas early actinides have low fourth ionisation energies and so for example neptunium and plutonium can reach +7[110][142][143] The very last actinides go further than the lanthanides towards low oxidation states: mendelevium is more easily reduced to the +2 state than thulium or even europium (the lanthanide with the most stable +2 state, on account of its half-filled f-shell), and nobelium outright favours +2 over +3, in contrast to ytterbium[54] As elements in the same group share the same valence configurations, they usually exhibit similar chemical behaviour For example, the alkali metals in the first group all have one valence electron, and form a very homogeneous class of elements: they are all soft and reactive metals However, there are many factors involved, and groups can often be rather heterogeneous For instance, hydrogen also has one valence electron and is in the same group as the alkali metals, but its chemical behaviour is quite different The stable elements of group 14 comprise a nonmetal (carbon), two semiconductors (silicon and germanium), and two metals (tin and lead); they are nonetheless united by having four valence electrons[144] This often leads to similarities in maximum and minimum oxidation states (eg sulfur and selenium in group 16 both have maximum oxidation state +6, as in SO3 and SeO3, and minimum oxidation state ‚àí2, as in sulfides and selenides); but not always (eg oxygen is not known to form oxidation state +6, despite being in the same group as sulfur and selenium)[58] Electronegativity Electrostatic potential map of a water molecule, where the oxygen atom has a more negative charge (red) than the positive (blue) hydrogen atoms Another important property of elements is their electronegativity Atoms can form covalent bonds to each other by sharing electrons in pairs, creating an overlap of valence orbitals The degree to which each atom attracts the shared electron pair depends on the atom's electronegativity[145] ‚Äì the tendency of an atom towards gaining or losing electrons[32] The more electronegative atom will tend to attract the electron pair more, and the less electronegative (or more electropositive) one will attract it less In extreme cases, the electron can be thought of as having been passed completely from the more electropositive atom to the more electronegative one, though this is a simplification The bond then binds two ions, one positive (having given up the electron) and one negative (having accepted it), and is termed an ionic bond[32] Electronegativity depends on how strongly the nucleus can attract an electron pair, and so it exhibits a similar variation to the other properties already discussed: electronegativity tends to fall going up to down, and rise going left to right The alkali and alkaline earth metals are among the most electropositive elements, while the chalcogens, halogens, and noble gases are among the most electronegative ones[145] Electronegativity is generally measured on the Pauling scale, on which the most electronegative reactive atom (fluorine) is given electronegativity 40, and the least electronegative atom (caesium) is given electronegativity 079[32] In fact neon is the most electronegative element, but the Pauling scale cannot measure its electronegativity because it does not form covalent bonds with most elements[146] An element's electronegativity varies with the identity and number of the atoms it is bonded to, as well as how many electrons it has already lost: an atom becomes more electronegative when it has lost more electrons[145] This sometimes makes a large difference: lead in the +2 oxidation state has electronegativity 187 on the Pauling scale, while lead in the +4 oxidation state has electronegativity 233[147] Metallicity The diamond-cubic structure, a giant covalent structure adopted by carbon (as diamond), as well as by silicon, germanium, and (grey) tin, all in group 14(In grey tin, the band gap vanishes and metallization occurs[148] Tin has another allotrope, white tin, whose structure is even more metallic) A simple substance is a substance formed from atoms of one chemical element The simple substances of the more electronegative atoms tend to share electrons (form covalent bonds) with each other They form either small molecules (like hydrogen or oxygen, whose atoms bond in pairs) or giant structures stretching indefinitely (like carbon or silicon) The noble gases simply stay as single atoms, as they already have a full shell[32] Substances composed of discrete molecules or single atoms are held together by weaker attractive forces between the molecules, such as the London dispersion force: as electrons move within the molecules, they create momentary imbalances of electrical charge, which induce similar imbalances on nearby molecules and create synchronized movements of electrons across many neighbouring molecules[149] Graphite and diamond, two allotropes of carbon The more electropositive atoms, however, tend to instead lose electrons, creating a \\\"sea\\\" of electrons engulfing cations[32] The outer orbitals of one atom overlap to share electrons with all its neighbours, creating a giant structure of molecular orbitals extending over all the atoms[150] This negatively charged \\\"sea\\\" pulls on all the ions and keeps them together in a metallic bond Elements forming such bonds are often called metals; those which do not are often called nonmetals[32] Some elements can form multiple simple substances with different structures: these are called allotropes For example, diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon[144][n] The metallicity of an element can be predicted from electronic properties When atomic orbitals overlap during metallic or covalent bonding, they create both bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals of equal capacity, with the antibonding orbitals of higher energy Net bonding character occurs when there are more electrons in the bonding orbitals than there are in the antibonding orbitals Metallic bonding is thus possible when the number of electrons delocalized by each atom is less than twice the number of orbitals contributing to the overlap This is the situation for elements in groups 1 through 13; they also have too few valence electrons to form giant covalent structures where all atoms take equivalent positions, and so almost all of them metallise The exceptions are hydrogen and boron, which have too high an ionisation energy Hydrogen thus forms a covalent H2 molecule, and boron forms a giant covalent structure based on icosahedral B12 clusters In a metal, the bonding and antibonding orbitals have overlapping energies, creating a single band that electrons can freely flow through, allowing for electrical conduction[152] Graph of carbon atoms being brought together to form a diamond crystal, demonstrating formation of the electronic band structure and band gap The right graph shows the energy levels as a function of the spacing between atoms When far apart (right side of graph) all the atoms have discrete valence orbitals p and s with the same energies However, when the atoms come closer (left side), their electron orbitals begin to spatially overlap The Pauli exclusion principle prohibits them from having the same energy, so the orbitals hybridize into N molecular orbitals each with a different energy, where N is the number of atoms in the crystal Since N is such a large number, adjacent orbitals are extremely close together in energy so the orbitals can be considered a continuous energy band At the actual diamond crystal cell size (denoted by a), two bands are formed, called the valence and conduction bands, separated by a 55 eV band gap (Here only the valence 2s and 2p electrons have been illustrated; the 1s orbitals do not significantly overlap, so the bands formed from them are much narrower) In group 14, both metallic and covalent bonding become possible In a diamond crystal, covalent bonds between carbon atoms are strong, because they have a small atomic radius and thus the nucleus has more of a hold on the electrons Therefore, the bonding orbitals that result are much lower in energy than the antibonding orbitals, and there is no overlap, so electrical conduction becomes impossible: carbon is a nonmetal However, covalent bonding becomes weaker for larger atoms and the energy gap between the bonding and antibonding orbitals decreases Therefore, silicon and germanium have smaller band gaps and are semiconductors at ambient conditions: electrons can cross the gap when thermally excited (Boron is also a semiconductor at ambient conditions) The band gap disappears in tin, so that tin and lead become metals[152] As the temperature rises, all nonmetals develop some semiconducting properties, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the size of the band gap Thus metals and nonmetals may be distinguished by the temperature dependence of their electrical conductivity: a metal's conductivity lowers as temperature rises (because thermal motion makes it more difficult for the electrons to flow freely), whereas a nonmetal's conductivity rises (as more electrons may be excited to cross the gap)[153] Elements in groups 15 through 17 have too many electrons to form giant covalent molecules that stretch in all three dimensions For the lighter elements, the bonds in small diatomic molecules are so strong that a condensed phase is disfavoured: thus nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), white phosphorus and yellow arsenic (P4 and As4), sulfur and red selenium (S8 and Se8), and the stable halogens (F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2) readily form covalent molecules with few atoms The heavier ones tend to form long chains (eg red phosphorus, grey selenium, tellurium) or layered structures (eg carbon as graphite, black phosphorus, grey arsenic, antimony, bismuth) that only extend in one or two rather than three dimensions Both kinds of structures can be found as allotropes of phosphorus, arsenic, and selenium, although the long-chained allotropes are more stable in all three As these structures do not use all their orbitals for bonding, they end up with bonding, nonbonding, and antibonding bands in order of increasing energy Similarly to group 14, the band gaps shrink for the heavier elements and free movement of electrons between the chains or layers becomes possible Thus for example black phosphorus, black arsenic, grey selenium, tellurium, and iodine are semiconductors; grey arsenic, antimony, and bismuth are semimetals (exhibiting quasi-metallic conduction, with a very small band overlap); and polonium and probably astatine are true metals[152] Finally, the natural group 18 elements all stay as individual atoms[152][o] The dividing line between metals and nonmetals is roughly diagonal from top left to bottom right, with the transition series appearing to the left of this diagonal (as they have many available orbitals for overlap) This is expected, as metallicity tends to be correlated with electropositivity and the willingness to lose electrons, which increases right to left and up to down Thus the metals greatly outnumber the nonmetals Elements near the borderline are difficult to classify: they tend to have properties that are intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals, and may have some properties characteristic of both They are often termed semimetals or metalloids[32] The term \\\"semimetal\\\" used in this sense should not be confused with its strict physical sense having to do with band structure: bismuth is physically a semimetal, but is generally considered a metal by chemists[155] The following table considers the most stable allotropes at standard conditions The elements coloured yellow form simple substances that are well-characterised by metallic bonding Elements coloured light blue form giant network covalent structures, whereas those coloured dark blue form small covalently bonded molecules that are held together by weaker van der Waals forces The noble gases are coloured in violet: their molecules are single atoms and no covalent bonding occurs Greyed-out cells are for elements which have not been prepared in sufficient quantities for their most stable allotropes to have been characterized in this way Theoretical considerations and current experimental evidence suggest that all of those elements would metallise if they could form condensed phases,[152] except perhaps for oganesson[156][p] vteBonding of simple

there are several, the most stable allotrope is considered Iron, a metal Sulfur, a nonmetal Arsenic, an element often called a semi-metal or metalloid Generally, metals are shiny and dense[32] They usually have high melting and boiling points due to the strength of the metallic bond, and are often malleable and ductile (easily stretched and shaped) because the atoms can move relative to each other without breaking the metallic bond[166] They conduct electricity because their electrons are free to move in all three dimensions Similarly, they conduct heat, which is transferred by the electrons as extra kinetic energy: they move faster These properties persist in the liquid state, as although the crystal structure is destroyed on melting, the atoms still touch and the metallic bond persists, though it is weakened[166] Metals tend to be reactive towards nonmetals[32] Some exceptions can be found to these generalizations: for example, beryllium, chromium,[84] manganese,[167] antimony,[168] bismuth,[169] and uranium are brittle (not an exhaustive list);[84] chromium is extremely hard;[170] gallium, rubidium, caesium, and mercury are liquid at or close to room temperature;[q] and noble metals such as gold are chemically very inert[171][172] Nonmetals exhibit different properties Those forming giant covalent crystals exhibit high melting and boiling points, as it takes considerable energy to overcome the strong covalent bonds Those forming discrete molecules are held together mostly by dispersion forces, which are more easily overcome; thus they tend to have lower melting and boiling points,[173] and many are liquids or gases at room temperature[32] Nonmetals are often dull-looking They tend to be reactive towards metals, except for the noble gases, which are inert towards most substances[32] They are brittle when solid as their atoms are held tightly in place They are less dense and conduct electricity poorly,[32] because there are no mobile electrons[174] Near the borderline, band gaps are small and thus many elements in that region are semiconductors, such as silicon, germanium,[174] and tellurium[152] Selenium has both a semiconducting grey allotrope and an insulating red allotrope; arsenic has a metallic grey allotrope, a semiconducting black allotrope, and an insulating yellow allotrope (though the last is unstable at ambient conditions)[153] Again there are exceptions; for example, diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of all known materials, greater than any metal[175] It is common to designate a class of metalloids straddling the boundary between metals and nonmetals, as elements in that region are intermediate in both physical and chemical properties[32] However, no consensus exists in the literature for precisely which elements should be so designated When such a category is used, silicon, germanium, arsenic, and tellurium are almost always included, and boron and antimony usually are; but most sources include other elements as well, without agreement on which extra elements should be added, and some others subtract from this list instead[r] For example, unlike all the other elements generally considered metalloids or nonmetals, antimony's only stable form has metallic conductivity Moreover, the element resembles bismuth and, more generally, the other p-block metals in its physical and chemical behaviour On this basis some authors have argued that it is better classified as a metal than as a metalloid[84][180][153] On the other hand, selenium has some semiconducting properties in its most stable form (though it also has insulating allotropes) and it has been argued that it should be considered a metalloid[180] ‚Äì though this situation also holds for phosphorus,[153] which is a much rarer inclusion among the metalloids[r] Further manifestations of periodicity There are some other relationships throughout the periodic table between elements that are not in the same group, such as the diagonal relationships between elements that are diagonally adjacent (eg lithium and magnesium)[121] Some similarities can also be found between the main groups and the transition metal groups, or between the early actinides and early transition metals, when the elements have the same number of valence electrons Thus uranium somewhat resembles chromium and tungsten in group 6,[121] as all three have six valence electrons[181] Relationships between elements with the same number of valence electrons but different types of valence orbital have been called secondary or isodonor relationships: they usually have the same maximum oxidation states, but not the same minimum oxidation states For example, chlorine and manganese both have +7 as their maximum oxidation state (eg Cl2O7 and Mn2O7), but their respective minimum oxidation states are ‚àí1 (eg HCl) and ‚àí3 (K2[Mn(CO)4]) Elements with the same number of valence vacancies but different numbers of valence electrons are related by a tertiary or isoacceptor relationship: they usually have similar minimum but not maximum oxidation states For example, hydrogen and chlorine both have ‚àí1 as their minimum oxidation state (in hydrides and chlorides), but hydrogen's maximum oxidation state is +1 (eg H2O) while chlorine's is +7[58] Many other physical properties of the elements exhibit periodic variation in accordance with the periodic law, such as melting points, boiling points, heats of fusion, heats of vaporization, atomisation energy, and so on Similar periodic variations appear for the compounds of the elements, which can be observed by comparing hydrides, oxides, sulfides, halides, and so on[145] Chemical properties are more difficult to describe quantitatively, but likewise exhibit their own periodicities Examples include the variation in the acidic and basic properties of the elements and their compounds, the stabilities of compounds, and methods of isolating the elements[113] Periodicity is and has been used very widely to predict the properties of unknown new elements and new compounds, and is central to modern chemistry[182] Classification of elements A periodic table colour-coded to show some commonly used sets of similar elements The categories and their boundaries differ somewhat between sources[176] Lutetium and lawrencium in group 3 are also transition metals[58] Alkali metals Alkaline earth metals Lanthanides Actinides Transition metals Other metals Metalloids Other nonmetals Halogens Noble gases Many terms have been used in the literature to describe sets of elements that behave similarly The group names alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, triel, tetrel, pnictogen, chalcogen, halogen, and noble gas are acknowledged by IUPAC; the other groups can be referred to by their number, or by their first element (eg, group 6 is the chromium group)[22][183] Some divide the p-block elements from groups 13 to 16 by metallicity,[178][176] although there is neither an IUPAC definition nor a precise consensus on exactly which elements should be considered metals, nonmetals, or semi-metals (sometimes called metalloids)[178][176][22] Neither is there a consensus on what the metals succeeding the transition metals ought to be called, with post-transition metal and poor metal being among the possibilities having been used Some advanced monographs exclude the elements of group 12 from the transition metals on the grounds of their sometimes quite different chemical properties, but this is not a universal practice[184] and IUPAC does not presently mention it as allowable in its Principles of Chemical Nomenclature[185] The lanthanides are considered to be the elements La‚ÄìLu, which are all very similar to each other: historically they included only Ce‚ÄìLu, but lanthanum became included by common usage[22] The rare earth elements (or rare earth metals) add scandium and yttrium to the lanthanides[22] Analogously, the actinides are considered to be the elements Ac‚ÄìLr (historically Th‚ÄìLr),[22] although variation of properties in this set is much greater than within the lanthanides[52] IUPAC recommends the names lanthanoids and actinoids to avoid ambiguity, as the -ide suffix typically denotes a negative ion; however lanthanides and actinides remain common[22] With the increasing recognition of lutetium and lawrencium as d-block elements, some authors began to define the lanthanides as La‚ÄìYb and the actinides as Ac‚ÄìNo, matching the f-block[57][25][186][187][188][189] The transactinides or superheavy elements are the short-lived elements beyond the actinides, starting at lawrencium or rutherfordium (depending on where the actinides are taken to end)[189][190][191][192][193] Many more categorizations exist and are used according to certain disciplines In astrophysics, a metal is defined as any element with atomic number greater than 2, ie anything except hydrogen and helium[194] The term \\\"semimetal\\\" has a different definition in physics than it does in chemistry: bismuth is a semimetal by physical definitions, but chemists generally consider it a metal[195] A few terms are widely used, but without any very formal definition, such as \\\"heavy metal\\\", which has been given such a wide range of definitions that it has been criticized as \\\"effectively meaningless\\\"[196] The scope of terms varies significantly between authors For example, according to IUPAC, the noble gases extend to include the whole group, including the very radioactive superheavy element oganesson[197] However, among those who specialize in the superheavy elements, this is not often done: in this case \\\"noble gas\\\" is typically taken to imply the unreactive behaviour of the lighter elements of the group Since calculations generally predict that oganesson should not be particularly inert due to relativistic effects, and may not even be a gas at room temperature if it could be produced in bulk, its status as a noble gas is often questioned in this context[198] Furthermore, national variations are sometimes encountered: in Japan, alkaline earth metals often do not include beryllium and magnesium as their behaviour is different from the heavier group 2 metals[199] History Main article: History of the periodic table See also: Timeline of chemical element discoveries Early history In 1817, German physicist Johann Wolfgang D√∂bereiner began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements[200] In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties He termed these groups triads[201][202] Chlorine, bromine, and iodine formed a triad; as did calcium, strontium, and barium; lithium, sodium, and potassium; and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium Today, all these triads form part of modern-day groups: the halogens, alkaline earth metals, alkali metals, and chalcogens[203] Various chemists continued his work and were able to identify more and more relationships between small groups of elements However, they could not build one scheme that encompassed them all[204] Newlands's table of the elements in 1866 John Newlands published a letter in the Chemical News in February 1863 on the periodicity among the chemical elements[205] In 1864 Newlands published an article in the Chemical News showing that if the elements are arranged in the order of their atomic weights, those having consecutive numbers frequently either belong to the same group or occupy similar positions in different groups, and he pointed out that each eighth element starting from a given one is in this arrangement a kind of repetition of the first, like the eighth note of an octave in music (The Law of Octaves)[205] However, Newlands's formulation only worked well for the main-group elements, and encountered serious problems with the others[58] German chemist Lothar Meyer noted the sequences of similar chemical and physical properties repeated at periodic intervals According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates (ie vertically) and the atomic volumes as abscissas (ie horizontally)‚Äîthe curve obtained a series of maximums and minimums‚Äîthe most electropositive elements would appear at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their valence‚Äîfor the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights[206] In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death[207] Mendeleev Mendeleev's 1869 periodic tableMendeleev's 1871 periodic table The definitive breakthrough came from the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev Although other chemists (including Meyer) had found some other versions of the periodic system at about the same time, Mendeleev was the most dedicated to developing and defending his system, and it was his system that most affected the scientific community[208] On 17 February 1869 (1 March 1869 in the Gregorian calendar), Mendeleev began arranging the elements and comparing them by their atomic weights He began with a few elements, and over the course of the day his system grew until it encompassed most of the known elements After he found a consistent arrangement, his printed table appeared in May 1869 in the journal of the Russian Chemical Society[209] When elements did not appear to fit in the system, he boldly predicted that either valencies or atomic weights had been measured incorrectly, or that there was a missing element yet to be discovered[58] In 1871, Mendeleev published a long article, including an updated form of his table, that made his predictions for unknown elements explicit Mendeleev predicted the properties of three of these unknown elements in detail: as they would be missing heavier homologues of boron, aluminium, and silicon, he named them eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicon (\\\"eka\\\" being Sanskrit for \\\"one\\\")[209][210]: 45 In 1875, the French chemist Paul-√âmile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, working without knowledge of Mendeleev's prediction, discovered a new element in a sample of the mineral sphalerite, and named it gallium He isolated the element and began determining its properties Mendeleev, reading de Boisbaudran's publication, sent a letter claiming that gallium was his predicted eka-aluminium Although Lecoq de Boisbaudran was initially sceptical, and suspected that Mendeleev was trying to take credit for his discovery, he later admitted that Mendeleev was correct[211] In 1879, the Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson discovered a new element, which he named scandium: it turned out to be eka-boron Eka-silicon was found in 1886 by German chemist Clemens Winkler, who named it germanium The properties of gallium, scandium, and germanium matched what Mendeleev had predicted[212] In 1889, Mendeleev noted at the Faraday Lecture to the Royal Institution in London that he had not expected to live long enough \\\"to mention their discovery to the Chemical Society of Great Britain as a confirmation of the exactitude and generality of the periodic law\\\"[213] Even the discovery of the noble gases at the close of the 19th century, which Mendeleev had not predicted, fitted neatly into his scheme as an eighth main group[214] Mendeleev nevertheless had some trouble fitting the known lanthanides into his scheme, as they did not exhibit the periodic change in valencies that the other elements did After much investigation, the Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner suggested in 1902 that the lanthanides could all be placed together in one group on the periodic table He named this the \\\"asteroid hypothesis\\\" as an astronomical analogy: just as there is an asteroid belt instead of a single planet between Mars and Jupiter, so the place below yttrium was thought to be occupied by all the lanthanides instead of just one element[33] Atomic number Periodic table of Antonius van den Broek After the internal structure of the atom was probed, amateur Dutch physicist Antonius van den Broek proposed in 1913 that the nuclear charge determined the placement of elements in the periodic table[215][216] The New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford coined the word \\\"atomic number\\\" for this nuclear charge[217] In van den Broek's published article he illustrated the first electronic periodic table showing the elements arranged according to the number of their electrons[218] Rutherford confirmed in his 1914 paper that Bohr had accepted the view of van den Broek[219] The same year, English physicist Henry Moseley using X-ray spectroscopy confirmed van den Broek's proposal experimentally Moseley determined the value of the nuclear charge of each element from aluminium to gold and showed that Mendeleev's ordering actually places the elements in sequential order by nuclear charge[220] Nuclear charge is identical to proton count and determines the value of the atomic number (Z) of each element Using atomic number gives a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties; these were cases such as tellurium and iodine, where atomic number increases but atomic weight decreases[215] Although Moseley was soon killed in World War I, the Swedish physicist Manne Siegbahn continued his work up to uranium, and established that it was the element with the highest atomic number then known (92)[221] Based on Moseley and Siegbahn's research, it was also known which atomic numbers corresponded to missing elements yet to be found: 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87[215] (Element 75 had in fact already been found by Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa in 1908 and named nipponium, but he mistakenly assigned it as element 43 instead of 75 and so his discovery was not generally recognized until later The contemporarily accepted discovery of element 75 came in 1925, when Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke, and Otto Berg independently rediscovered it and gave it its present name, rhenium)[222] The dawn of atomic physics also clarified the situation of isotopes In the decay chains of the primordial radioactive elements thorium and uranium, it soon became evident that there were many apparent new elements that had different atomic weights but exactly the same chemical properties In 1913, Frederick Soddy coined the term \\\"isotope\\\" to describe this situation, and considered isotopes to merely be different forms of the same chemical element This furthermore clarified discrepancies such as tellurium and iodine: tellurium's natural isotopic composition is weighted towards heavier isotopes than iodine's, but tellurium has a lower atomic number[223] Electron shells The Danish physicist Niels Bohr applied Max Planck's idea of quantization to the atom He concluded that the energy levels of electrons were quantised: only a discrete set of stable energy states were allowed Bohr then attempted to understand periodicity through electron configurations, surmising in 1913 that the inner electrons should be responsible for the chemical properties of the element[224][225] In 1913, he produced the first electronic periodic table based on a quantum atom[226] Bohr called his electron shells \\\"rings\\\" in 1913: atomic orbitals within shells did not exist at the time of his planetary model Bohr explains in Part 3 of his famous 1913 paper that the maximum electrons in a shell is eight, writing, \\\"We see, further, that a ring of n electrons cannot rotate in a single ring round a nucleus of charge ne unless n < 8\\\" For smaller atoms, the electron shells would be filled as follows: \\\"rings of electrons will only join if they contain equal numbers of electrons; and that accordingly the numbers of electrons on inner rings will only be 2, 4, 8\\\" However, in larger atoms the innermost shell would contain eight electrons: \\\"on the other hand, the periodic system of the elements strongly suggests that already in neon N = 10 an inner ring of eight electrons will occur\\\" His proposed electron configurations for the atoms (shown to the right) mostly do not accord with those now known[227][228] They were improved further after the work of Arnold Sommerfeld and Edmund Stoner discovered more quantum numbers[223] Bohr's electron configurations for light elements Element Electrons per shell 4 2,2 6 2,4 7 4,3 8 4,2,2 9 4,4,1 10 8,2 11 8,2,1 16 8,4,2,2 18 8,8,2 The first one to systematically expand and correct the chemical potentials of Bohr's atomic theory was Walther Kossel in 1914 and in 1916 Kossel explained that in the periodic table new elements would be created as electrons were added to the outer shell In Kossel's paper, he writes: \\\"This leads to the conclusion that the electrons, which are added further, should be put into concentric rings or shells, on each of which only a certain number of electrons‚Äînamely, eight in our case‚Äîshould be arranged As soon as one ring or shell is completed, a new one has to be started for the next element; the number of electrons, which are most easily accessible, and lie at the outermost periphery, increases again from element to element and, therefore, in the formation of each new shell the chemical periodicity is repeated\\\"[229][230] In a 1919 paper, Irving Langmuir postulated the existence of \\\"cells\\\" which we now call orbitals, which could each only contain two electrons each, and these were arranged in \\\"equidistant layers\\\" which we now call shells He made an exception for the first shell to only contain two electrons[231] The chemist Charles Rugeley Bury suggested in 1921 that eight and eighteen electrons in a shell form stable configurations Bury proposed that the electron configurations in transitional elements depended upon the valence electrons in their outer shell[232] He introduced the word transition to describe the elements now known as transition metals or transition elements[233] Bohr's theory was vindicated by the discovery of element 72: Georges Urbain claimed to have discovered it as the rare earth element celtium, but Bury and Bohr had predicted that element 72 could not be a rare earth element and had to be a homologue of zirconium Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy searched for the element in zirconium ores and found element 72, which they named hafnium after Bohr's hometown of Copenhagen (Hafnia in Latin)[234][235] Urbain's celtium proved to be simply purified lutetium (element 71)[236] Hafnium and rhenium thus became the last stable elements to be discovered[223] Prompted by Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli took up the problem of electron configurations in 1923 Pauli extended Bohr's scheme to use four quantum numbers, and formulated his exclusion principle which stated that no two electrons could have the same four quantum numbers This explained the lengths of the periods in the periodic table (2, 8, 18, and 32), which corresponded to the number of electrons that each shell could occupy[237] In 1925, Friedrich Hund arrived at configurations close to the modern ones[238] As a result of these advances, periodicity became based on the number of chemically active or valence electrons rather than by the valences of the elements[58] The Aufbau principle that describes the electron configurations of the elements was first empirically observed by Erwin Madelung in 1926,[45] though the first to publish it was Vladimir Karapetoff in 1930[239][240] In 1961, Vsevolod Klechkovsky derived the first part of the Madelung rule (that orbitals fill in order of increasing n + ‚Ñì) from the Thomas‚ÄìFermi model;[241] the complete rule was derived from a similar potential in 1971 by Yury N Demkov and Valentin N Ostrovsky[242][s] Periodic table of Alfred Werner (1905), the first appearance of the long form[33] The quantum theory clarified the transition metals and lanthanides as forming their own separate groups, transitional between the main groups, although some chemists had already proposed tables showing them this way before then: the English chemist Henry Bassett did so in 1892, the Danish chemist Julius Thomsen in 1895, and the Swiss chemist Alfred Werner in 1905 Bohr used Thomsen's form in his 1922 Nobel Lecture; Werner's form is very similar to the modern 32-column form In particular, this supplanted Brauner's asteroidal hypothesis[33] The exact position of the lanthanides, and thus the composition of group 3, remained under dispute for decades longer because their electron configurations were initially measured incorrectly[25][92] On chemical grounds Bassett, Werner, and Bury grouped scandium and yttrium with lutetium rather than lanthanum (the former two left an empty space below yttrium as lutetium had not yet been discovered)[33][232] Hund assumed in 1927 that all the lanthanide atoms had configuration [Xe]4f0‚àí145d16s2, on account of their prevailing trivalency It is now known that the relationship between chemistry and electron configuration is more complicated than that[t][54] Early spectroscopic evidence seemed to confirm these configurations, and thus the periodic table was structured to have group 3 as scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium, with fourteen f-elements breaking up the d-block between lanthanum and hafnium[25] But it was later discovered that this is only true for four of the fifteen lanthanides (lanthanum, cerium, gadolinium, and lutetium), and that the other lanthanide atoms do not have a d-electron In particular, ytterbium completes the 4f shell and thus Soviet physicists Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz noted in 1948 that lutetium is correctly regarded as a d-block rather than an f-block element;[26] that bulk lanthanum is an f-metal was first suggested by Jun Kond≈ç in 1963, on the grounds of its low-temperature superconductivity[100] This clarified the importance of looking at low-lying excited states of atoms that can play a role in chemical environments when classifying elements by block and positioning them on the table[63][65][25] Many authors subsequently rediscovered this correction based on physical, chemical, and electronic concerns and applied it to all the relevant elements, thus making group 3 contain scandium, yttrium, lutetium, and lawrencium[63][23][92] and having lanthanum through ytterbium and actinium through nobelium as the f-block rows:[63][23] this corrected version achieves consistency with the Madelung rule and vindicates Bassett, Werner, and Bury's initial chemical placement[33] In 1988, IUPAC released a report supporting this composition of group 3,[23] a decision that was reaffirmed in 2021[24] Variation can still be found in textbooks on the composition of group 3,[35] and some argumentation against this format is still published today,[27] but chemists and physicists who have considered the matter largely agree on group 3 containing scandium, yttrium, lutetium, and lawrencium and challenge the counterarguments as being inconsistent[27] Synthetic elements Glenn T Seaborg By 1936, the pool of missing elements from hydrogen to uranium had shrunk to four: elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 remained missing Element 43 eventually became the first element to be synthesized artificially via nuclear reactions rather than discovered in nature It was discovered in 1937 by Italian chemists Emilio Segr√® and Carlo Perrier, who named their discovery technetium, after the Greek word for \\\"artificial\\\"[243] Elements 61 (promethium) and 85 (astatine) were likewise produced artificially in 1945 and 1940 respectively; element 87 (francium) became the last element to be discovered in nature, by French chemist Marguerite Perey in 1939[244][u] The elements beyond uranium were likewise discovered artificially, starting with Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson's 1940 discovery of neptunium (via bombardment of uranium with neutrons)[75] Glenn T Seaborg and his team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) continued discovering transuranium elements, starting with plutonium in 1941, and discovered that contrary to previous thinking, the elements from actinium onwards were congeners of the lanthanides rather than transition metals[245] Bassett (1892), Werner (1905), and the French engineer Charles Janet (1928) had previously suggested this, but their ideas did not then receive general acceptance[33] Seaborg thus called them the actinides[245] Elements up to 101 (named mendelevium in honour of Mendeleev) were synthesized up to 1955, either through neutron or alpha-particle irradiation, or in nuclear explosions in the cases of 99 (einsteinium) and 100 (fermium)[75] A significant controversy arose with elements 102 through 106 in the 1960s and 1970s, as competition arose between the LBNL team (now led by Albert Ghiorso) and a team of Soviet scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) led by Georgy Flyorov Each team claimed discovery, and in some cases each proposed their own name for the element, creating an element naming controversy that lasted decades These elements were made by bombardment of actinides with light ions[246] IUPAC at first adopted a hands-off approach, preferring to wait and see if a consensus would be forthcoming But as it was also the height of the Cold War, it became clear that this would not happen As such, IUPAC and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) created a Transfermium Working Group (TWG, fermium being element 100) in 1985 to set out criteria for discovery,[247] which were published in 1991[248] After some further controversy, these elements received their final names in 1997, including seaborgium (106) in honour of Seaborg[249] Yuri Oganessian The TWG's criteria were used to arbitrate later element discovery claims from LBNL and JINR, as well as from research institutes in Germany (GSI) and Japan (Riken)[250] Currently, consideration of discovery claims is performed by a IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party After priority was assigned, the elements were officially added to the periodic table, and the discoverers were invited to propose their names[6] By 2016, this had occurred for all elements up to 118, therefore completing the periodic table's first seven rows[6][251] The discoveries of elements beyond 106 were made possible by techniques devised by Yuri Oganessian at the JINR: cold fusion (bombardment of lead and bismuth by heavy ions) made possible the 1981‚Äì2004 discoveries of elements 107 through 112 at GSI and 113 at Riken, and he led the JINR team (in collaboration with American scientists) to discover elements 114 through 118 using hot fusion (bombardment of actinides by calcium ions) in 1998‚Äì2010[252][253] The heaviest known element, oganesson (118), is named in Oganessian's honour Element 114 is named flerovium in honour of his predecessor and mentor Flyorov[253] In celebration of the periodic table's 150th anniversary, the United Nations declared the year 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table, celebrating \\\"one of the most significant achievements in science\\\"[254] The discovery criteria set down by the TWG were updated in 2020 in response to experimental and theoretical progress that had not been foreseen in 1991[255] Today, the periodic table is among the most recognisable icons of chemistry[81] IUPAC is involved today with many processes relating to the periodic table: the recognition and naming of new elements, recommending group numbers and collective names, and the updating of atomic weights[6] Future extension beyond the seventh period Main article: Extended periodic table See also: Island of stability Energy eigenvalues (in eV) for the outermost electrons of elements with Z = 100 through 172, predicted using Dirac‚ÄìFock calculations The ‚àí and + signs refer to orbitals with decreased or increased azimuthal quantum number from spin‚Äìorbit splitting respectively: p‚àí is p1/2, p+ is p3/2, d‚àí is d3/2, d+ is d5/2, f‚àí is f5/2, f+ is f7/2, g‚àí is g7/2, and g+ is g9/2[256] The spacing of energy levels up to Z = 120 is normal, and becomes normal again at Z = 157; between them, a very different situation is observed[257] The most recently named elements ‚Äì nihonium (113), moscovium (115), tennessine (117), and oganesson (118) ‚Äì completed the seventh row of the periodic table[6] Future elements would have to begin an eighth row These elements may be referred to either by their atomic numbers (eg \\\"element 164\\\"), or by the IUPAC systematic element names adopted in 1978, which directly relate to the atomic numbers (eg \\\"unhexquadium\\\" for element 164, derived from Latin unus \\\"one\\\", Greek hexa \\\"six\\\", Latin quadra \\\"four\\\", and the traditional -ium suffix for metallic elements)[6] All attempts to synthesize such elements have failed so far An attempt to make element 119 has been ongoing since 2018 at the Riken research institute in Japan The LBNL in the United States, the JINR in Russia, and the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) in China also plan to make their own attempts at synthesizing the first few period 8 elements[258][259][260][261][262][263] If the eighth period followed the pattern set by the earlier periods, then it would contain fifty elements, filling the 8s, 5g, 6f, 7d, and finally 8p subshells in that order But by this point, relativistic effects should result in significant deviations from the Madelung rule Various different models have been suggested for the configurations of eighth-period elements, as well as how to show the results in a periodic table All agree that the eighth period should begin like the previous ones with two 8s elements, 119 and 120 However, after that the massive energetic overlaps between the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p subshells means that they all begin to fill together, and it is not clear how to separate out specific 5g and 6f series[59][264][265][266][267] Elements 121 through 156 thus do not fit well as chemical analogues of any previous group in the earlier parts of the table,[128] although they have sometimes been placed as 5g, 6f, and other series to formally reflect their electron configurations[128] Eric Scerri has raised the question of whether an extended periodic table should take into account the failure of the Madelung rule in this region, or if such exceptions should be ignored[264] The shell structure may also be fairly formal at this point: already the electron distribution in an oganesson atom is expected to be rather uniform, with no discernible shell structure[268] The situation from elements 157 to 172 should return to normalcy and be more reminiscent of the earlier rows[257] The heavy p-shells are split by the spin‚Äìorbit interaction: one p-orbital (p1/2) is more stabilized, and the other two (p3/2) are destabilized (Such shifts in the quantum numbers happen for all types of shells, but it makes the biggest difference to the order for the p-shells) It is likely that by element 157, the filled 8s and 8p1/2 shells with four electrons in total have sunk into the core Beyond the core, the next orbitals are 7d and 9s at similar energies, followed by 9p1/2 and 8p3/2 at similar energies, and then a large gap[257] Thus, the 9s and 9p1/2 orbitals in essence replace the 8s and 8p1/2 ones, making elements 157‚Äì172 probably chemically analogous to groups 3‚Äì18: for example, element 164 would appear two places below lead in group 14 under the usual pattern, but is calculated to be very analogous to palladium in group 10 instead[54][266][59][256][128] Thus, it takes fifty-four elements rather than fifty to reach the next noble element after 118[269] However, while these conclusions about elements 157 through 172's chemistry are generally agreed by models,[128][59] there is disagreement on whether the periodic table should be drawn to reflect chemical analogies, or if it should reflect likely formal electron configurations, which should be quite different from earlier periods and are not agreed between sources Discussion about the format of the eighth row thus continues[59][266][267][104] Beyond element 172, calculation is complicated by the 1s electron energy level becoming imaginary Such a situation does have a physical interpretation and does not in itself pose an electronic limit to the periodic table, but the correct way to incorporate such states into multi-electron calculations is still an open question needing to be solved to calculate the periodic table's structure beyond this point[270] Nuclear stability will likely prove a decisive factor constraining the number of possible elements It depends on the balance between the electric repulsion between protons and the strong force binding protons and neutrons together[271] Protons and neutrons are arranged in shells, just like electrons, and so a closed shell can significantly increase stability: the known superheavy nuclei exist because of such a shell closure, probably at around 114‚Äì126 protons and 184 neutrons[270] They are probably close to a predicted island of stability, where superheavy nuclides should be more long-lived than expected: predictions for the longest-lived nuclides on the island range from microseconds to millions of years[104][272][273] It should nonetheless be noted that these are essentially extrapolations into an unknown part of the chart of nuclides, and systematic model uncertainties need to be taken into account[104] As the closed shells are passed, the stabilizing effect should vanish[274] Thus, superheavy nuclides with more than 184 neutrons are expected to have much shorter lifetimes, spontaneously fissioning within 10‚àí15 seconds If this is so, then it would not make sense to consider them chemical elements: IUPAC defines an element to exist only if the nucleus lives longer than 10‚àí14 seconds, the time needed for it to gather an electron cloud Nonetheless, theoretical estimates of half-lives are very model-dependent, ranging over many orders of magnitude[270] The extreme repulsion between protons is predicted to result in exotic nuclear topologies, with bubbles, rings, and tori expected: this further complicates extrapolation[104] It is not clear if any further-out shell closures exist, due to an expected smearing out of distinct nuclear shells (as is already expected for the electron shells at oganesson)[274] Furthermore, even if later shell closures exist, it is not clear if they would allow such heavy elements to exist[275][276][277][178] As such, it may be that the periodic table practically ends around element 120, as elements become too short-lived to observe, and then too short-lived to have chemistry; the era of discovering new elements would thus be close to its end[178][278] If another proton shell closure beyond 126 does exist, then it probably occurs around 164;[275] thus the region where periodicity fails more or less matches the region of instability between the shell closures[128] Alternatively, quark matter may become stable at high mass numbers, in which the nucleus is composed of freely flowing up and down quarks instead of binding them into protons and neutrons; this would create a continent of stability instead of an island[279][280] Other effects may come into play: for example, in very heavy elements the 1s electrons are likely to spend a significant amount of time so close to the nucleus that they are actually inside it, which would make them vulnerable to electron capture[281] Even if eighth-row elements can exist, producing them is likely to be difficult, and it should become even more difficult as atomic number rises[282] Although the 8s elements 119 and 120 are expected to be reachable with present means, the elements beyond that are expected to require new technology,[283] if they can be produced at all[284] Experimentally characterizing these elements chemically would also pose a great challenge[258] Alternative periodic tables Main article: Types of periodic tables Otto Theodor Benfey's spiral periodic table (1964) The periodic law may be represented in multiple ways, of which the standard periodic table is only one[285] Within 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleev's table in 1869, Edward G Mazurs had collected an estimated 700 different published versions of the periodic table[181][286] Many forms retain the rectangular structure, including Charles Janet's left-step periodic table (pictured below), and the modernised form of Mendeleev's original 8-column layout that is still common in Russia Other periodic table formats have been shaped much more exotically, such as spirals (Otto Theodor Benfey's pictured to the right), circles and triangles[287] Alternative periodic tables are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables, with different ones skewed more towards emphasizing chemistry or physics at either end[288] The standard form, which remains by far the most common, is somewhere in the middle[288] The many different forms of the periodic table have prompted the questions of whether there is an optimal or definitive form of the periodic table, and if so, what it might be There are no current consensus answers to either question[289][288] Janet's left-step table is being increasingly discussed as a candidate for being the optimal or most fundamental form; Scerri has written in support of it, as it clarifies helium's nature as an s-block element, increases regularity by having all period lengths repeated, faithfully follows Madelung's rule by making each period correspond to one value of n + ‚Ñì,[g] and regularises atomic number triads and the first-row anomaly trend While he notes that its placement of helium atop the alkaline earth metals can be seen a disadvantage from a chemical perspective, he counters this by appealing to the first-row anomaly, pointing out that the periodic table \\\"fundamentally reduces to quantum mechanics\\\", and that it is concerned with \\\"abstract elements\\\" and hence atomic properties rather than macroscopic properties[295] vteLeft-step periodic table (by Charles Janet) f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 f10 f11 f12 f13 f14 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8 d9 d10 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 s1 s2 1s H He 2s Li Be

d-block p-block s-block This form of periodic table is congruent with the order in which electron shells are ideally filled according to the Madelung rule, as shown in the accompanying sequence in the left margin (read from top to bottom, left to right) The experimentally determined ground-state electron configurations of the elements differ from the configurations predicted by the Madelung rule in twenty instances, but the Madelung-predicted configurations are always at least close to the ground state The last two elements shown, elements 119 and 120, have not yet been synthesized See also Nucleosynthesis Notes ^ a b The question of how many natural elements there are is quite complicated and is not fully resolved The heaviest element that occurs in large quantities on Earth is element 92, uranium However, uranium can undergo spontaneous fission in nature, and the resulting neutrons can strike other uranium atoms If neutron capture then occurs, elements 93 and 94, neptunium and plutonium, are formed via beta decay;[10] these are in fact more common than some of the rarest elements in the first 92, such as promethium, astatine, and francium (see Abundance of elements in Earth's crust) Theoretically, neutron capture on the resulting plutonium might produce even higher-numbered elements, but the quantities would be too small to be observed[10] In the early Solar System, shorter-lived elements had not yet decayed away, and consequently there were more than 94 naturally occurring elements Curium (element 96) is the longest-lived element beyond the first 94, and is probably still being brought to Earth via cosmic rays, but it has not been found[10] Elements up to 99 (einsteinium) have been observed in Przybylski's Star[11] Elements up to 100 (fermium) probably occurred in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo Mine, Gabon, but they have long since decayed away[12] Even heavier elements may be produced in the r-process via supernovae or neutron star mergers, but this has not been confirmed It is not clear how far they would extend past 100 and how long they would last: calculations suggest that nuclides of mass number around 280 to 290 are formed in the r-process, but quickly beta decay to nuclides that suffer spontaneous fission, so that 999% of the produced superheavy nuclides would decay within a month[13] If instead they were sufficiently long-lived, they might similarly be brought to Earth via cosmic rays, but again none have been found[10] ^ Some isotopes currently considered stable are theoretically expected to be radioactive with extremely long half-lives: for instance, all the stable isotopes of elements 62 (samarium), 63 (europium), and all elements from 67 (holmium) onward are expected to undergo alpha decay or double beta decay However, the predicted half-lives are extremely long (eg the alpha decay of 208Pb to the ground state of 204Hg is expected to have a half-life greater than 10120 years), and the decays have never been observed[16][17] ^ The half-life of plutonium's most stable isotope is just long enough that it should also be a primordial element A 1971 study claimed to have detected primordial plutonium,[18] but a more recent study from 2012 could not detect it[19] Based on its likely initial abundance in the Solar System, present experiments as of 2022 are likely about an order of magnitude away from detecting live primordial 244Pu[20] ^ Tiny traces of plutonium are also continually brought to Earth via cosmic rays[21] ^ See for example the periodic table poster sold by Sigma-Aldrich ^ Strictly speaking, one cannot draw an orbital such that the electron is guaranteed to be inside it, but it can be drawn to guarantee a 90% probability of this for example[41] ^ a b Authors differ on whether the n + ‚Ñì rule has yet been derived from quantum mechanics Scerri claims that it has not,[290][291] despite several attempts to do so[292] On the other hand, Ostrovsky, who has claimed such justification from 1971, wrote 'Some authors insist that \\\"still nobody has deduced the n+l rule from the principles of quantum mechanics\\\", while others present quantum justification of the rule that was not ever disputed'[293] Other authors argue that such a derivation is not necessary, because it admits exceptions[294] ^ Once two to four electrons are removed, the d and f orbitals usually become lower in energy than the s ones:[52] 1s ‚â™ 2s < 2p ‚â™ 3s < 3p ‚â™ 3d < 4s < 4p ‚â™ 4d < 5s < 5p ‚â™ 4f < 5d < 6s < 6p ‚â™ 5f < 6d < 7s < 7p ‚â™ and in the limit for extremely highly charged ions, orbitals simply fill in the order of increasing n instead There is a gradual transition between the limiting situations of highly charged ions (increasing n) and neutral atoms (Madelung's rule)[45] Thus for example, the energy order for the 55th electron outside the xenon core proceeds as follows in the isoelectronic series of caesium (55 electrons):[53] Cs0: 6s < 6p < 5d < 7s < 4f Ba+: 6s < 5d < 6p < 7s < 4f La2+: 5d < 4f < 6s < 6p < 7s Ce3+: 4f < 5d < 6s < 6p < 7s and in the isoelectronic series of holmium (67 electrons), a Ho0 atom is [Xe]4f116s2, but Er+ is [Xe]4f126s1, Tm2+ through W7+ are [Xe]4f13, and from Re8+ onward the configuration is [Cd]4f145p5 following the hydrogenic order[54][55] Also, the ordering of the orbitals between each ‚â™ changes somewhat throughout each period For example, the ordering in argon and potassium is 3p ‚â™ 4s < 4p ‚â™ 3d; by calcium it has become 3p ‚â™ 4s < 3d < 4p; from scandium to copper it is 3p ‚â™ 3d < 4s < 4p; and from zinc to krypton it is 3p < 3d ‚â™ 4s < 4p[51] as the d-orbitals fall into the core at gallium[56][57] Deeply buried core shells in heavy atoms thus come closer to the hydrogenic order: around osmium (Z = 76) 4f falls below 5p, and around bismuth (Z = 83) 4f falls below 5s as well[54] ^ In fact, electron configurations represent a first-order approximation: an atom really exists in a superposition of multiple configurations, and electrons in an atom are indistinguishable[28] The elements in the d- and f-blocks have multiple configurations separated by small energies and can change configuration depending on the chemical environment[52] In some of the undiscovered g-block elements, mixing of configurations may become so important that the result can no longer be well-described by a single configuration[59] ^ Compounds that would use the 6d orbitals of nihonium as valence orbitals have been theoretically investigated, but they are all expected to be too unstable to observe[71] ^ Properties of the p-block elements nevertheless do affect the succeeding s-block elements The 3s shell in sodium is above a kainosymmetric 2p core, but the 4s shell in potassium is above the much larger 3p core Hence while one would have already expected potassium atoms to be larger than sodium atoms, the size difference is greater than usual[96] ^ There are many lower oxides as well: for example, phosphorus in group 15 forms two oxides, P2O3 and P2O5[113] ^ The normally \\\"forbidden\\\" intermediate oxidation states may be stabilized by forming dimers, as in [Cl3Ga‚ÄìGaCl3]2‚àí (gallium in the +2 oxidation state) or S2F10 (sulfur in the +5 oxidation state)[140] Some compounds that appear to be in such intermediate oxidation states are actually mixed-valence compounds, such as Sb2O4, which contains both Sb(III) and Sb(V)[141] ^ The boundary between dispersion forces and metallic bonding is gradual, like that between ionic and covalent bonding Characteristic metallic properties do not appear in small mercury clusters, but do appear in large ones[151] ^ All this describes the situation at standard pressure Under sufficiently high pressure, the band gaps of any solid drop to zero and metallization occurs Thus for example at about 170 kbar iodine becomes a metal,[152] and metallic hydrogen should form at pressures of about four million atmospheres[154] See metallization pressure for values for all nonmetals ^ Descriptions of the structures formed by the elements can be found throughout Greenwood and Earnshaw There are two borderline cases Arsenic's most stable form conducts electricity like a metal, but the bonding is significantly more localized to the nearest neighbours than it is for the similar structures of antimony and bismuth,[157] and unlike normal metals it does not have a long liquid range, but rather sublimes instead Hence its structure is better treated as network covalent[158] Carbon as graphite shows metallic conduction parallel to its planes, but is a semiconductor perpendicular to them Some computations predict copernicium and flerovium to be nonmetallic,[159][160] but the most recent experiments on them suggest that they are metallic[161][162][163] Astatine is calculated to metallise at standard conditions,[164] so presumably tennessine should as well[165] ^ See melting points of the elements (data page) The same is probably true of francium, but due to its extreme instability, this has never been experimentally confirmed Copernicium and flerovium are expected to be liquids,[159][160] similar to mercury, and experimental evidence suggests that they are metals[161][162][163] ^ a b See lists of metalloids For example, a periodic table used by the American Chemical Society includes polonium as a metalloid,[176] but one used by the Royal Society of Chemistry does not,[177] and that included in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica does not refer to metalloids or semi-metals at all[178] Classification can change even within a single work For example, Sherwin and Weston's Chemistry of the Non-Metallic Elements (1966) has a periodic table on p 7 classifying antimony as a nonmetal, but on p 115 it is called a metal[179] ^ Demkov and Ostrovsky consider the potential U 1 / 2 ( r ) = ‚àí 2 v r R ( r + R ) 2 {\\\\displaystyle U_{1/2}(r)=-{\\\\frac {2v}{rR(r+R)^{2}}}} where R {\\\\displaystyle R} and v {\\\\displaystyle v} are constant parameters; this approaches a Coulomb potential for small r {\\\\displaystyle r} When v {\\\\displaystyle v} satisfies the condition v = v N = 1 4 R 2 N ( N + 1 ) {\\\\displaystyle v=v_{N}={\\\\frac {1}{4}}R^{2}N(N+1)} , where N = n + l {\\\\displaystyle N=n+l} , the zero-energy solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for this potential can be described analytically with Gegenbauer polynomials As v {\\\\displaystyle v} passes through each of these values, a manifold containing all states with that value of N {\\\\displaystyle N} arises at zero energy and then becomes bound, recovering the Madelung order Perturbation-theory considerations show that states with smaller n {\\\\displaystyle n} have lower energy, and that the s-orbitals (with l = 0 {\\\\displaystyle l=0} ) have their energies approaching the next n + l {\\\\displaystyle n+l} group[242][90] ^ For example, the early actinides continue to behave more like the d-block transition metals in their propensity towards high oxidation states all the way from actinium to uranium, even though it is actually only actinium and thorium that have d-block-like configurations in the gas phase; f-electrons appear already at protactinium[110] Uranium's actual configuration of [Rn]5f36d17s2 is in fact analogous to that Hund assumed for the lanthanides, but uranium does not favour the trivalent state, preferring to be tetravalent or hexavalent[54] On the other hand, lanthanide-like configurations for the actinides begin at plutonium, but the shift towards lanthanide-like behaviour is only clear at curium: the elements between uranium and curium form a transition from transition-metal-like behaviour to lanthanide-like behaviour[110] Thus chemical behaviour and electron configuration do not exactly match each other[110] ^ Technetium, promethium, astatine, neptunium, and plutonium were eventually discovered to occur in nature as well, albeit in tiny traces See

existing sample Discoverer(s) Place of oldest sample Notes 6 Carbon 26000 BC 26000 BC Earliest humans Charcoal and soot were known to the earliest humans, with the oldest known charcoal paintings dating to about 28000 years ago, eg Gabarnmung in Australia[1][2] The earliest known industrial use of charcoal was for the reduction of copper, zinc, and tin ores in the manufacture of bronze, by the Egyptians and Sumerians[3] Diamonds were probably known as early as 2500 BC[4] True chemical analyses were made in the 18th century,[5] and in 1772 Antoine Lavoisier demonstrated that diamond, graphite, and charcoal are all composed of the same substance[1] In 1787, de Morveau, Fourcroy, and Lavoisier listed carbon (in French, carbone) as an element, distinguishing it from coal (in French, charbon)[1] 29 Copper 9000 BC 6000 BC Middle East Asia Minor Copper was probably the first metal mined and crafted by humans[6] It was originally obtained as a native metal and later from the smelting of ores Earliest estimates of the discovery of copper suggest around 9000 BC in the Middle East It was one of the most important materials to humans throughout the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages Copper beads dating from 6000 BC have been found in √áatalh√∂y√ºk, Anatolia[7] and the archaeological site of Belovode on the Rudnik mountain in Serbia contains the world's oldest securely dated evidence of copper smelting from 5000 BC[8][9] Recognised as an element by Louis Guyton de Morveau, Antoine Lavoisier, Claude Berthollet, and Antoine-Fran√ßois de Fourcroy in 1787[1] 82 Lead 7000 BC 3800 BC Asia Minor Abydos, Egypt It is believed that lead smelting began at least 9,000 years ago, and the oldest known artifact of lead is a statuette found at the temple of Osiris on the site of Abydos dated around 3800 BC[10] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787[1] 79 Gold Before 6000 BC Before 4000 BC Levant Wadi Qana The earliest gold artifacts were discovered at the site of Wadi Qana in the Levant[11] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787[1] 47 Silver Before 5000 BC ca 4000 BC Asia Minor Asia Minor Estimated to have been discovered in Asia Minor shortly after copper and gold[12][13] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787[1] 26 Iron Before 5000 BC 4000 BC Middle East Egypt There is evidence that iron was known from before 5000 BC[14] The oldest known iron objects used by humans are some beads of meteoric iron, made in Egypt in about 4000 BC The discovery of smelting around 3000 BC led to the start of the Iron Age around 1200 BC[15] and the prominent use of iron for tools and weapons[16] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787[1] 50 Tin 3500 BC 2000 BC Asia Minor Kestel First smelted in combination with copper around 3500 BC to produce bronze (and thus giving place to the Bronze Age in those places where Iron Age did not intrude directly on Neolithic of the Stone Age)[clarification needed][17] Kestel, in southern Turkey, is the site of an ancient Cassiterite mine that was used from 3250 to 1800 BC[18] The oldest artifacts date from around 2000 BC[19] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787[1] 51 Antimony 3000 BC 3000 BC Sumerians Middle East An artifact, said to be part of a vase, made of very pure antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at Telloh, Chaldea (part of present-day Iraq)[20] Dioscorides and Pliny both describe the accidental production of metallic antimony from stibnite, but only seem to recognize the metal as lead[21] The intentional isolation of antimony is described in the works attributed to the Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (c 850‚Äì950)[22] In Europe, the metal was being produced and used by 1540, when it was described by Vannoccio Biringuccio[23] Described again by Georgius Agricola De re metallica in 1556 Probably first recognised as an element by Lavoisier in 1787[1] 16 Sulfur Before 2000 BC Middle East Middle East First used at least 4,000 years ago[24] According to the Ebers Papyrus, a sulfur ointment was used in ancient Egypt to treat granular eyelids (The Ebers papyrus was written c 1550 BC, but is believed to have been copied from earlier texts)[25][26] Designated as one of the two elements of which all metals are composed in the sulfur-mercury theory of metals, first described in pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana's Sirr al-khaliqa ('Secret of Creation') and in the works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan (both 8th or 9th century)[27] Designated as a universal element (one of the tria prima) by Paracelsus in the early 16th century Recognized as an element by Lavoisier in 1777, which was supported by John Dalton in 1808 and confirmed by Joseph Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Th√©nard in 1810[1] 80 Mercury 1500 BC 1500 BC Egyptians Egypt Cinnabar (the most common mineral form of mercury(II) sulfide, HgS) was used as a pigment from prehistory, dating as far back as the 9th millennium BC in the Middle East[28] Cinnabar deposits in Turkey, exploited from 8000 years ago, also contain minor amounts of mercury metal[29] Found in Egyptian tombs dating from 1500 BC[30] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787[1] 30 Zinc Before 1000 BC 1000 BC Indian metallurgists Indian subcontinent Used as a component of brass since antiquity (before 1000 BC) by Indian metallurgists, but its true nature was not generally understood in ancient times A 4th century BC vase from Taxila is made of brass with a zinc content of 34%, too high to be produced by cementation, providing strong evidence that metallic zinc was known in India by the 4th century BC[31] Zinc smelting was done in China and India around 1300[1] Identified as a distinct metal in the Rasaratna Samuccaya around the 14th century of the Christian era[32] and by the alchemist Paracelsus in 1526,[33] who gave it its present name and described it as a new metal[1] P M de Respour isolated it from zinc oxide in 1668;[1] the first detailed documentation of zinc isolation was given by Andreas Sigismund Marggraf in 1746[34] 78 Platinum c 600 BC ‚Äì AD 200 c 600 BC ‚Äì AD 200 Pre-Columbian South Americans South America Used by pre-Columbian Americans near modern-day Esmeraldas, Ecuador to produce artifacts of a white gold-platinum alloy, although precise dating is difficult[35] A small box from the burial of the Pharaoh Shepenupet II (died around 650 BC) was found to be decorated with gold-platinum hieroglyphics,[36] but the Egyptians may not have recognised that there was platinum in their gold[37][38] First European description of a metal found in South American gold was in 1557 by Julius Caesar Scaliger Antonio de Ulloa was on an expedition to Peru in 1735, where he observed the metal; he published his findings in 1748 Charles Wood also investigated the metal in 1741 First reference to it as a new metal was made by William Brownrigg in 1750[39] 33 Arsenic c AD 300 c AD 300 Egyptians Middle East The use of metallic arsenic was described by the Egyptian alchemist Zosimos[40] The purification of arsenic was later described in the works attributed to the Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (c 850‚Äì950)[22] Albertus Magnus (c 1200‚Äì1280) is typically credited with the description of the metal in the West,[41] though some question his work and instead credit Vannoccio Biringuccio, whose De la pirotechnia (1540) distinguishes orpiment from crystalline arsenic The first to unquestionably have prepared metallic arsenic was Johann Schr√∂der in 1641 Recognised as an element after Lavoisier's definition in 1787[1] 83 Bismuth c 1500[42] c 1500 European alchemists and Inca civilisation Europe and South America Bismuth was known since ancient times, but often confused with tin and lead, which are chemically similar The Incas used bismuth (along with the usual copper and tin) in a special bronze alloy for knives[43] Agricola (1530 and 1546) states that bismuth is a distinct metal in a family of metals including tin and lead This was based on observation of the metals and their physical properties[1][44] Miners in the age of alchemy also gave bismuth the name tectum argenti, or \\\"silver being made\\\" in the sense of silver still in the process of being formed within the Earth[45][46][47] Beginning with Johann Heinrich Pott in 1738,[48] Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and Torbern Olof Bergman, the distinctness of lead and bismuth became clear, and Claude Fran√ßois Geoffroy demonstrated in 1753 that this metal is distinct from lead and tin[46][49][50] Modern discoveries[edit] For 18th-century discoveries, around the time that Antoine Lavoisier first questioned the phlogiston theory, the recognition of a new \\\"earth\\\" has been regarded as being equivalent to the discovery of a new element (as was the general practice then) For some elements (eg Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Zr, Mo),[51] this presents further difficulties as their compounds were widely known since medieval or even ancient times, even though the elements themselves were not Since the true nature of those compounds was sometimes only gradually discovered, it is sometimes very difficult to name one specific discoverer[1][52] In such cases the first publication on their chemistry is noted, and a longer explanation given in the notes[1][52] Z Element Observed or predicted Isolated (widely known) Notes Year By Year By 15 Phosphorus 1669 H Brand 1669 H Brand Prepared and isolated from urine, it was the first element whose discovery date and discoverer are recorded[53] Its name first appears in print in the work of Georg Kaspar Kirchmayer [de] in 1676 Recognised as an element by Lavoisier[1] 1 Hydrogen 1671 R Boyle 1671 R Boyle Robert Boyle produced it by reacting iron filings with dilute acid[54][55] Henry Cavendish in 1766 was the first to distinguish H2 from other gases[56] Lavoisier named it in 1783[57][58] It was the first elemental gas known 11 Sodium 1702 G E Stahl 1807 H Davy Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702,[59] and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736[60] Andreas Sigismund Marggraf again recognised the difference between soda ash and potash in 1758, but not all chemists accepted his conclusion In 1797, Martin Heinrich Klaproth suggested the names natron and kali for the two alkalis (whence the symbols) Davy isolated sodium metal a few days after potassium, by using electrolysis on sodium hydroxide[61] and potash[62] respectively 19 Potassium 1702 G E Stahl 1807 H Davy 27 Cobalt 1735 G Brandt 1735 G Brandt Proved that the blue color of glass is due to a new kind of metal and not bismuth as thought previously[63] 20 Calcium 1739 J H Pott 1808 H Davy Lime was known as a substance for centuries, but only in the 18th century was its chemical nature recognised Pott recognised terra calcarea (calcareous earth) as an individual \\\"earth\\\" in his treatise of 1739 Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy suggested in 1787 that it was the oxide of an element Davy isolated the metal electrochemically from quicklime[1] 14 Silicon 1739 J H Pott 1823 J Berzelius Silicon compounds (rock crystals and glass) were known to the ancients, but its chemical investigation dates only to the 17th century Johann Joachim Becher (of the phlogiston theory) identified silica as the terra vitrescibilis, and Johann Heinrich Pott recognised it as an individual \\\"earth\\\" in his treatise of 1739[1] Silica appears as a \\\"simple earth\\\" in the M√©thode de nomenclature chimique, and in 1789 Lavoisier concluded that the element must exist[1] Davy thought in 1800 that silica was a compound, not an element, and in 1808 he proved this although he could not isolate the element, and suggested the name silicium[64][65] In 1811 Louis-Joseph Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Th√©nard probably prepared impure silicon,[66] and Berzelius obtained the pure element in 1823[67] The name was proposed to be changed to silicon by Thomas Thomson in 1817, and this was eventually accepted because of its analogies to boron and carbon 13 Aluminium 1746 J H Pott 1824 HC√òrsted Paracelsus recognised aluminis as separate from vitriol in 1570, and Andreas Libavius proposed in his 1597 treatise to name the unknown earth of alum alumina In 1746, Johann Heinrich Pott published a treatise distinguishing alum from lime and chalk, and Marggraf precipitated the new earth in 1756[1] Antoine Lavoisier predicted in 1787 that alumina is the oxide of an undiscovered element, and in 1808 Davy tried to decompose it Although he failed, he proved Lavoisier correct and suggested the present name[64][68] Hans Christian √òrsted was the first to isolate metallic aluminium in 1824[69][70] 28 Nickel 1751 F Cronstedt 1751 F Cronstedt Found by attempting to extract copper from the mineral known as fake copper (now known as niccolite)[71] 12 Magnesium 1755 J Black 1808 H Davy Joseph Black observed that magnesia alba (MgO) was not quicklime (CaO) in 1755; until then, both substances had been confused Davy isolated the metal electrochemically from magnesia[72] 9 Fluorine 1771 W Scheele 1886 H Moissan Fluorspar was described by Georgius Agricola in 1529[73] Scheele studied fluorspar and correctly concluded it to be the lime (calcium) salt of an acid[74] Radical fluorique appears on the list of elements in Lavoisier's Trait√© √âl√©mentaire de Chimie from 1789, but radical muriatique also appears instead of chlorine[75] Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re again predicted in 1810 that hydrofluoric acid contained an element analogous to chlorine, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain it It was eventually isolated by Moissan[76] 8 Oxygen 1771 W Scheele 1771 W Scheele Scheele obtained it by heating mercuric oxide and nitrates in 1771, but did not publish his findings until 1777 Joseph Priestley also prepared this new air by 1774, but only Lavoisier recognized it as a true element; he named it in 1777[77][78] Before him, Sendivogius had produced oxygen by heating saltpetre, correctly identifying it as the \\\"food of life\\\"[79] 7 Nitrogen 1772 D Rutherford 1772 D Rutherford Rutherford discovered nitrogen while studying at the University of Edinburgh[80] He showed that the air in which animals had breathed, even after removal of the exhaled carbon dioxide, was no longer able to burn a candle Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley also studied the element at about the same time, and Lavoisier named it in 1775‚Äì6[81] 56 Barium 1772 W Scheele 1808 H Davy Scheele distinguished a new earth (BaO) in pyrolusite in 1772 He did not name his discovery; Guyton de Morveau suggested barote in 1782[1] It was changed to baryte in the M√©thode de nomenclature chimique of Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Antoine Lavoisier, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy (1787) Davy isolated the metal by electrolysis[82] 25 Manganese 1774 W Scheele 1774 J G Gahn Distinguished pyrolusite as the calx of a new metal Ignatius Gottfred Kaim might have isolated it in 1770, but there is uncertainty on that It was isolated by reduction of manganese dioxide with carbon Given its present name in 1779 by Guyton de Morveau; prior to that it was called magnesia[1][83] 17 Chlorine 1774 W Scheele 1774 W Scheele Obtained it from hydrochloric acid, but thought it was an oxide Only in 1808 did Humphry Davy recognize it as an element[84][85] 42 Molybdenum 1778 W Scheele 1788 J Hjelm Scheele recognised the metal as a constituent of molybdena[86] Before that, Axel Cronstedt had assumed that molybdena contained a new earth in 1758[1] 74 Tungsten 1781 W Scheele 1783 J and F Elhuyar Scheele showed that scheelite (then called tungsten) was a salt of calcium with a new acid, which he called tungstic acid The Elhuyars obtained tungstic acid from wolframite and reduced it with charcoal, naming the element \\\"volfram\\\"[1][87] Since that time both names, tungsten and wolfram, have been used depending on language[1] In 1949 IUPAC made wolfram the scientific name, but this was repealed after protest in 1951 in favour of recognising both names pending a further review (which never materialised) Currently only tungsten is recognised for use in English[85] 52 Tellurium 1782 F-JM von Reichenstein 1798 H Klaproth Muller observed it as an impurity in gold ores from Transylvania[88] Klaproth isolated it in 1798[85] 38 Strontium 1787 W Cruikshank 1808 H Davy W Cruikshank in 1787 and Adair Crawford in 1790 concluded that strontianite contained a new earth It was eventually isolated electrochemically in 1808 by Davy[89] 5 Boron 1787 L Guyton de Morveau, A Lavoisier, C L Berthollet, and A de Fourcroy 1809 H Davy Borax was known from ancient times In 1787, radical boracique appeared in the M√©thode de nomenclature chimique of Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Antoine Lavoisier, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy[1] It also appears in Lavoisier's Trait√© √âl√©mentaire de Chimie from 1789[75] In 1808, Lussac and Th√©nard announced a new element in sedative salt and named it bore Davy announced the isolation of a new substance from boracic acid in 1809, naming it boracium[90] As the element turned out not to be a metal, he revised his proposal to boron in 1812[1] 1789 A Lavoisier Lavoisier writes the first modern list of chemical elements ‚Äì containing 33 elements including light and heat but omitting Na, K (he was unsure of whether soda and potash without carbonic acid, ie Na2O and K2O, are simple substances or compounds like NH3),[91] Sr, Te; some elements were listed in the table as unextracted \\\"radicals\\\" (Cl, F, B) or as oxides (Ca, Mg, Ba, Al, Si)[75] He also redefines the term \\\"element\\\" Until then, no metals except mercury were considered elements 40 Zirconium 1789 H Klaproth 1824 J Berzelius Martin Heinrich Klaproth identified a new oxide in zircon in 1789,[92][93] and in 1808 Davy showed that this oxide has a metallic base although he could not isolate it[64][94] 92 Uranium 1789 H Klaproth 1841 E-M P√©ligot Klaproth mistakenly identified a uranium oxide obtained from pitchblende as the element itself and named it after the recently discovered planet Uranus[95][96] 22 Titanium 1791 W Gregor 1825 J Berzelius Gregor found an oxide of a new metal in ilmenite; Klaproth independently discovered the element in rutile in 1795 and named it The pure metallic form was only obtained in 1910 by Matthew A Hunter[97][98] 39 Yttrium 1794 J Gadolin 1843 H Rose Johan Gadolin discovered the earth in gadolinite in 1794 He did not name his discovery, but Andreas Ekeberg did so when he confirmed it in 1797[1] Mosander showed later that its ore, yttria, contained more elements[99][100] In 1808, Davy showed that yttria is a metallic oxide, although he could not isolate the metal[64][101] W√∂hler mistakenly thought he had isolated the metal in 1828 from a volatile chloride he supposed to be yttrium chloride,[102][103] but Rose proved otherwise in 1843 and correctly isolated the element himself that year 24 Chromium 1797 N Vauquelin 1798 N Vauquelin Vauquelin analysed the composition of crocoite ore in 1797, and later isolated the metal by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven[1][104][105] 4 Beryllium 1798 N Vauquelin 1828 F W√∂hler and A Bussy Vauquelin discovered the oxide in beryl and emerald in 1798, and in 1808 Davy showed that this oxide has a metallic base although he could not isolate it[64][106] Vauquelin was uncertain about the name to give to the oxide: in 1798 he called it la terre du beril, but the journal editors named it glucine after the sweet taste of beryllium compounds (which are highly toxic) Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link proposed in 1799 to change the name from Glucine to Beryllerde or Berylline (because glucine resembled glycine), a suggestion taken up by Klaproth in 1800 in the form beryllina Klaproth had independently worked on beryl and emerald and likewise concluded that a new element was present The name beryllium for the element was first used by W√∂hler upon its isolation (Davy used the name glucium) Both names beryllium and glucinium were used (the latter mostly in France) until IUPAC decided on the name beryllium in 1949[1] 23 Vanadium 1801 A M del R√≠o 1867 H E Roscoe Andr√©s Manuel del R√≠o found the metal (calling it erythronium) in vanadinite in 1801, but the claim was rejected after Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils dismissed it as chromium based on erroneous and superficial testing[107] Nils Gabriel Sefstr√∂m rediscovered the element in 1830 and named it vanadium Friedrich W√∂hler then showed that vanadium was identical to erythronium and thus that del R√≠o had been right in the first place[108][109] Del R√≠o then argued passionately that his old claim be recognised, but the element kept the name vanadium[109] 41 Niobium 1801 C Hatchett 1864 W Blomstrand Hatchett found the element in columbite ore and named it columbium In 1809, W H Wollaston claimed that columbium and tantalum are identical, which proved to be false[85] Heinrich Rose proved in 1844 that the element is distinct from tantalum, and renamed it niobium American scientists generally used the name columbium, while European ones used niobium Niobium was officially accepted by IUPAC in 1949[110] 73 Tantalum 1802 G Ekeberg Ekeberg found another element in minerals similar to columbite, and named it after Tantalus from Greek mythology because of its inability to be dissolved by acids (just as Tantalus was tantalised by water that receded when he tried to drink it)[85] In 1809, W H Wollaston claimed that columbium and tantalum are identical, which proved to be false[85] In 1844, Heinrich Rose proved that the elements were distinct and renamed columbium to niobium (Niobe is the daughter of Tantalus)[111] 46 Palladium 1802 W H Wollaston 1802 W H Wollaston Wollaston discovered it in samples of platinum from South America, but did not publish his results immediately He had intended to name it after the newly discovered asteroid, Ceres, but by the time he published his results in 1804, cerium had taken that name Wollaston named it after the more recently discovered asteroid Pallas[112] 58 Cerium 1803 H Klaproth, J Berzelius, and W Hisinger 1826 G Mosander Berzelius and Hisinger discovered the element in ceria and named it after the newly discovered asteroid (then considered a planet), Ceres Klaproth discovered it simultaneously and independently in some tantalum samples Mosander proved later that the samples of all three researchers had at least another element in them, lanthanum[113] 76 Osmium 1803 S Tennant 1803 S Tennant Tennant had been working on samples of South American platinum in parallel with Wollaston and discovered two new elements, which he named osmium and iridium[114] 77 Iridium 1803 S Tennant and H-V Collet-Descotils 1803 S Tennant Tennant had been working on samples of South American platinum in parallel with Wollaston and discovered two new elements, which he named osmium and iridium, and published the iridium results in 1804[115] Collet-Descotils also found iridium the same year, but not osmium[85] 45 Rhodium 1804 H Wollaston 1804 H Wollaston Wollaston discovered and isolated it from crude platinum samples from South America[116] 53 Iodine 1811 B Courtois 1811 B Courtois Courtois discovered it in the ashes of seaweed[117] The name iode was given in French by Gay-Lussac and published in 1813[52] Davy gave it the English name iodine in 1814[52] 3 Lithium 1817 A Arfwedson 1821 W T Brande Arfwedson, a student of Berzelius, discovered the alkali in petalite[118] Brande isolated it electrolytically from lithium oxide[52] 48 Cadmium 1817 S L Hermann, F Stromeyer, and JCH Roloff 1817 S L Hermann, F Stromeyer, and JCH Roloff All three found an unknown metal in a sample of zinc oxide from Silesia, but the name that Stromeyer gave became the accepted one[119] 34 Selenium 1817 J Berzelius and G Gahn 1817 J Berzelius and G Gahn While working with lead they discovered a substance that they thought was tellurium, but realized after more investigation that it was different[120] 35 Bromine 1825 J Balard and C L√∂wig 1825 J Balard and C L√∂wig They both discovered the element in the autumn of 1825 Balard published his results the next year,[121] but L√∂wig did not publish until 1827[122] 90 Thorium 1829 J Berzelius 1914 D Lely, Jr and L Hamburger Berzelius obtained the oxide of a new earth in thorite[123] 57 Lanthanum 1838 G Mosander 1841 G Mosander Mosander found a new element in samples of ceria and published his results in 1842, but later he showed that this lanthana contained four more elements[124] 60 Neodymium 1841 G Mosander 1885 C A von Welsbach Discovered by Mosander and called didymium Carl Auer von Welsbach later split it into two elements, praseodymium and neodymium Neodymium had formed the greater part of the old didymium and received the prefix \\\"neo-\\\"[85][125] 68 Erbium 1843 G Mosander 1879 T Cleve Mosander managed to split the old yttria into yttria proper and erbia, and later terbia too[126] The names underwent some confusion: Mosander's erbia was yellow and his terbia was red But in 1860, Nils Johan Berlin could only find the rose-coloured earth, confusingly renamed as erbia, and questioned the existence of the yellow earth Marc Delafontaine adopted Berlin's nomenclature where erbia was the rose-coloured earth, but proved that the yellow earth also existed At the prompting of Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, he named the yellow earth terbia; thus Mosander's names were swapped from his original choices[52] 65 Terbium 1843 G Mosander 1886 JCG de Marignac Mosander managed to split the old yttria into yttria proper and erbia, and later terbia too[127] 44 Ruthenium 1844 K Claus 1844 K Claus Gottfried Wilhelm Osann thought that he found three new metals in Russian platinum samples in 1826, which he named polinium, pluranium, and ruthenium in 1828 But his results were questioned and he did not have enough quantities to isolate them, so he withdrew his claims in 1829[128] However, in 1844 Karl Karlovich Klaus confirmed that there was one new metal, and reused Osann's name \\\"ruthenium\\\"[129] 55 Caesium 1860 R Bunsen and R Kirchhoff 1882 C Setterberg Bunsen and Kirchhoff were the first to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis They discovered caesium by its two blue emission lines in a sample of D√ºrkheim mineral water[130] The pure metal was eventually isolated in 1882 by Setterberg[131] 37 Rubidium 1861 R Bunsen and G R Kirchhoff 1863 R Bunsen Bunsen and Kirchhoff discovered it just a few months after caesium, by observing new spectral lines in the mineral lepidolite[132] The metal was isolated by Bunsen around 1863[52] 81 Thallium 1861 W Crookes 1862 C-A Lamy Shortly after the discovery of rubidium, Crookes found a new green line in a selenium sample; later that year, Lamy found the element to be metallic[133] 49 Indium 1863 F Reich and T Richter 1864 T Richter Reich and Richter first identified it in sphalerite by its bright indigo-blue spectroscopic emission line[134] Richter isolated the metal the next year[52] 2 Helium 1868 N Lockyer 1895 W Ramsay, T Cleve, and N Langlet P Janssen and Lockyer observed independently a yellow line in the solar spectrum that did not match any other element However, only Lockyer made the correct conclusion that it was due to a new element This was the first observation of a noble gas, located in the Sun Years later after the isolation of argon on Earth, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet observed independently helium trapped in cleveite[135] 1869 D I Mendeleev Mendeleev arranges the 63 elements known at that time (omitting terbium, as chemists were unsure of its existence, and helium, as it was not found on Earth) into the first modern periodic table and correctly predicts several others 31 Gallium 1875 P E L de Boisbaudran 1878 P E L de Boisbaudran and E Jungfleisch Boisbaudran observed on a pyrenea blende sample some emission lines corresponding to the eka-aluminium that was predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 He and Jungfleisch isolated the metal three years later by electrolysis[136][137][52] 70 Ytterbium 1878 JCG de Marignac 1906 C A von Welsbach On October 22, 1878, Marignac reported splitting terbia into two new earths, terbia proper and ytterbia[138] 67 Holmium 1878 J-L Soret and M Delafontaine 1879 T Cleve Soret found it in samarskite and later, Per Teodor Cleve split Marignac's erbia into erbia proper and two new elements, thulium and holmium Delafontaine's philippium turned out to be identical to what Soret found[139][140] 21 Scandium 1879 F Nilson 1879 F Nilson Nilson split Marignac's ytterbia into pure ytterbia and a new element that matched Mendeleev's 1871 predicted eka-boron[141] 69 Thulium 1879 T Cleve 1879 T Cleve Cleve split Marignac's erbia into erbia proper and two new elements, thulium and holmium[142] 62 Samarium 1879 PEL de Boisbaudran 1879 PEL de Boisbaudran Boisbaudran noted a new earth in samarskite and named it samaria after the mineral[143] 64 Gadolinium 1880 J C G de Marignac 1886 PEL de Boisbaudran Marignac initially observed the new earth in terbia, and later Boisbaudran obtained a pure sample from samarskite[144] 59 Praseodymium 1885 C A von Welsbach Carl Auer von Welsbach discovered it in Mosander's didymia[145] 32 Germanium 1886 C A Winkler In February 1886 Winkler found in argyrodite the eka-silicon that Mendeleev had predicted in 1871[146] 66 Dysprosium 1886 PEL de Boisbaudran 1905 G Urbain De Boisbaudran found a new earth in erbia[147] 18 Argon 1894 Lord Rayleigh and W Ramsay 1894 Lord Rayleigh and W Ramsay They discovered the gas by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means It is the first noble gas to be isolated[148] 63 Europium 1896 E-A Demar√ßay 1901 E-A Demar√ßay Demar√ßay found spectral lines of a new element in Lecoq's samarium, and separated this element several years later[149] 36 Krypton 1898 W Ramsay and W Travers 1898 W Ramsay and W Travers On May 30, 1898, Ramsay separated a noble gas from liquid argon by difference in boiling point[150] 10 Neon 1898 W Ramsay and W Travers 1898 W Ramsay and W Travers In June 1898 Ramsay separated a new noble gas from liquid argon by difference in boiling point[150] 54 Xenon 1898 W Ramsay and W Travers 1898 W Ramsay and W Travers On July 12, 1898, Ramsay separated a third noble gas within three weeks, from liquid argon by difference in boiling point[151] 84 Polonium 1898 P and M Curie 1902 W Marckwald In an experiment done on July 13, 1898, the Curies noted an increased radioactivity in the uranium obtained from pitchblende, which they ascribed to an unknown element Independently rediscovered and isolated in 1902 by Marckwald, who named it radiotellurium[152] 88 Radium 1898 P and M Curie 1902 M Curie The Curies reported on December 26, 1898, a new element different from polonium, which Marie later isolated from uraninite[153] 86 Radon 1899 E Rutherford and R B Owens 1910 W Ramsay and R Whytlaw-Gray Rutherford and Owens discovered a radioactive gas resulting from the radioactive decay of thorium, isolated later by Ramsay and Gray In 1900, Friedrich Ernst Dorn discovered a longer-lived isotope of the same gas from the radioactive decay of radium Since \\\"radon\\\" was first used to specifically designate Dorn's isotope before it became the name for the element, he is often mistakenly given credit for the latter instead of the former[154][155] 89 Actinium 1902 F O Giesel 1903 F O Giesel Giesel obtained from pitchblende a substance that had properties similar to those of lanthanum and named it emanium[156] Andr√©-Louis Debierne had previously (in 1899 and 1900) reported the discovery of a new element actinium that was supposedly similar to titanium and thorium, which cannot have included much actual element 89 But by 1904, when Giesel and Debierne met, both had radiochemically pure element 89, and so Debierne has generally been given credit for the discovery[157] 71 Lutetium 1906 C A von Welsbach and G Urbain 1906 C A von Welsbach von Welsbach proved that the old ytterbium also contained a new element, which he named cassiopeium (he renamed the larger part of the old ytterbium to aldebaranium) Urbain also proved this at about the same time (von Welsbach's paper was published first, but Urbain sent his to the editor first), naming the new element lutetium and the old one neoytterbium (which later reverted to ytterbium) However, Urbain's samples were very impure and only contained trace quantities of the new element Despite this, his chosen name lutetium was adopted by the International Committee of Atomic Weights, whose membership included Urbain The German Atomic Weights Commission adopted cassiopeium for the next forty years Finally in 1949 IUPAC decided in favour of the name lutetium as it was more often used[85][158] 75 Rhenium 1908 M Ogawa 1919 M Ogawa Masataka Ogawa found it in thorianite in 1908, but assigned it as element 43 and named it nipponium (Elements 43 and 75 are in the same group of the periodic table)[159] Because of the erroneous assignment, and because some of his key results were published only in Japanese, his claim was not widely recognised However, the optical emission spectrum described by Ogawa and the X-ray photographic plate for one of his samples match element 75, and his claim has thus been rehabilitated in much of the modern literature[160] In 1925 Walter Noddack, Ida Eva Tacke and Otto Berg announced its separation from gadolinite, identified it correctly as element 75, and gave it the present name[161][162] 91 Protactinium 1913 O H G√∂hring and K Fajans 1927 A von Grosse The two obtained the first isotope of this element, 234mPa, that had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as a member of the natural decay of 238U: they named it brevium A longer-lived isotope 231Pa was found in 1918 by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner, and was named by them protoactinium: since it is longer-lived, it gave the element its name Protoactinium was changed to protactinium in 1949[163] Originally isolated in 1900 by William Crookes, who nevertheless did not recognize that it was a new element[164] 72 Hafnium 1922 D Coster and G von Hevesy 1922 D Coster and G von Hevesy Georges Urbain claimed to have found the element in rare-earth residues, while Vladimir Vernadsky independently found it in orthite Neither claim was confirmed due to World War I, and neither could be confirmed later, as the chemistry they reported does not match that now known for hafnium After the war, Coster and Hevesy found it by X-ray spectroscopic analysis in Norwegian zircon[165] Hafnium was the last stable element to be discovered (noting however the difficulties regarding the discovery of rhenium) 43 Technetium 1937 C Perrier and E Segr√® 1937 C Perrier & E Segr√® The two discovered a new element in a molybdenum sample that was used in a cyclotron, the first element to be discovered by synthesis It had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as eka-manganese[166][167][168] In 1952, Paul W Merrill found its spectral lines in S-type red giants[169] Minuscule trace quantities were finally found on Earth in 1962 by B T Kenna and Paul K Kuroda: they isolated it from Belgian Congo pitchblende, where it occurs as a spontaneous fission product of uranium[170] The Noddacks (rediscoverers of rhenium) claimed to have discovered element 43 in 1925 as well and named it masurium (after Masuria), but their claims were disproven by Kuroda, who calculated that there cannot have been enough technetium in their samples to have enabled a true detection[171] 87 Francium 1939 M Perey Perey discovered it as a decay product of 227Ac[172] Francium was the last element to be discovered in nature, rather than synthesized in the lab, although four of the \\\"synthetic\\\" elements that were discovered later (plutonium, neptunium, astatine, and promethium) were eventually found in trace amounts in nature as well[173] Before Perey, it is likely that Stefan Meyer, Viktor F Hess, and Friedrich Paneth had observed the decay of 227Ac to 223Fr in Vienna in 1914, but they could not follow up and secure their work because of the outbreak of World War I[173] 93 Neptunium 1940 EM McMillan and H Abelson Obtained by irradiating uranium with neutrons, it was the first transuranium element discovered[174] Shortly before that, Yoshio Nishina and Kenjiro Kimura discovered the uranium isotope 237U and found that it beta decays into 23793, but were unable to measure the activity of the element 93 product because its half-life was too long McMillan and Abelson succeeded because they used 239U, as 23993 has a much shorter half-life[175] McMillan and Abelson found that 23993 itself undergoes beta decay and must produce an isotope of element 94, but the quantities they used were not enough to isolate and identify element 94 along with 93[176] Natural traces were found in Belgian Congo pitchblende by D F Peppard et al in 1952[177] 85 Astatine 1940 D R Corson, K R MacKenzie and E Segr√® Obtained by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles[178] In 1943, Berta Karlik and Traude Bernert found it in nature; due to World War II, they were initially unaware of Corson et al's results[179] Horia Hulubei and Yvette Cauchois had previously claimed its discovery as a natural radioelement from 1936, naming it dor: they likely did have the isotope 218At, and probably did have enough sensitivity to distinguish its spectral lines But they could not chemically identify their discovery, and their work was doubted because of an earlier false claim by Hulubei to having discovered element 87[180][181] 94 Plutonium 1941 Glenn T Seaborg, Arthur C Wahl, W Kennedy and EM McMillan Prepared by bombardment of uranium with deuterons[182] Seaborg and Morris L Perlman then found it as traces in natural Canadian pitchblende in 1941‚Äì1942, though this work was kept secret until 1948[183] 96 Curium 1944 Glenn T Seaborg, Ralph A James and Albert Ghiorso Prepared by bombarding plutonium with alpha particles during the Manhattan Project[184] 95 Americium 1944 G T Seaborg, R A James, O Morgan and A Ghiorso Prepared by irradiating plutonium with neutrons during the Manhattan Project[185] 61 Promethium 1945 Charles D Coryell, Jacob A Marinsky, and Lawrence E Glendenin 1945 Charles D Coryell, Jacob A Marinsky, and Lawrence E Glendenin[186][187] It was probably first prepared at the Ohio State University in 1942 by bombarding neodymium and praseodymium with neutrons, but separation of the element could not be carried out Isolation was performed under the Manhattan Project in 1945[188] Found on Earth in trace quantities by Olavi Er√§mets√§ in 1965; so far, promethium is the most recent element to have been found on Earth[189] 97 Berkelium 1949 G Thompson, A Ghiorso and G T Seaborg (University of California, Berkeley) Created by bombardment of americium with alpha particles[190] 98 Californium 1950 S G Thompson, K Street, Jr, A Ghiorso and G T

beginner-level introduction to the syntax of selectors, see our guide on CSS Selectors Be aware that any syntax error in a rule definition invalidates the entire rule Invalid rules are ignored by the browser Note that CSS rule definitions are entirely (ASCII) text-based, whereas DOM-CSS / CSSOM (the rule management system) is object-basedAt-rule syntaxAs the structure of at-rules varies widely, please see At-rule to find the syntax of the specific one you wantIndex Note: This index does not include SVG-exclusive presentation attributes, which can be used as CSS properties on SVG elements

SelectorsThe following are the various selectors, which allow styles to be conditional based on various features of elements within the DOMBasic selectorsBasic selectors are fundamental selectors; these are the most basic selectors that are frequently combined to create other, more complex selectors Universal selector * Type selector elementname Class selector classname ID selector #idname Attribute selector [attr=value] Grouping selectors Selector list A, B Specifies that both A and B elements are selected This is a grouping method to select several matching elements CombinatorsCombinators are selectors that establish a relationship between two or more simple selectors, such as \\\"A is a child of B\\\" or \\\"A is adjacent to B\\\", creating a complex selector Next-sibling combinator A + B Specifies that the elements selected by both A and B have the same parent and that the element selected by B immediately follows the element selected by A horizontally Subsequent-sibling combinator A ~ B Specifies that the elements selected by both A and B share the same parent and that the element selected by A comes before√¢¬Ä¬îbut not necessarily immediately before√¢¬Ä¬îthe element selected by B Child combinator A > B Specifies that the element selected by B is the direct child of the element selected by A Descendant combinator A B Specifies that the element selected by B is a descendant of the element selected by A, but is not necessarily a direct child Column combinator A || B Experimental Specifies that the element selected by B is located within the table column specified by A Elements which span multiple columns are considered to be a member of all of those columns Pseudo Pseudo classes : Specifies a special state of the selected element(s) Pseudo elements :: Represents entities that are not included in HTML See also selectors in the Selectors specification and the pseudo-element specification ConceptsSyntax and semantics CSS

Python ¬ª 3131 Documentation ¬ª The Python Standard Library | Theme Auto Light Dark | The Python Standard Library√Ç¬∂ While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions Python√¢¬Ä¬ôs standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire standard library and often also include many additional components For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components In addition to the standard library, there is an active collection of hundreds of thousands of components (from individual programs and modules to packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the Python Package Index Introduction Notes on availability Built-in Functions abs() aiter() all() anext() any() ascii() bin() bool breakpoint() callable()

of people living with diabetes rose from 200 million in 1990 to 830 million in 2022 Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countriesMore than half of people living with diabetes did not take medication for their diabetes in 2022 Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countriesDiabetes causes blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputationIn 2021, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused over 2 million deaths In addition, around 11% of cardiovascular deaths were caused by high blood glucoseA healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetesDiabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complicationsOverviewDiabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels In 2022, 14% of adults aged 18 years and older were living with diabetes, an increase from 7% in 1990 More than half (59%) of adults aged 30 years and over living with diabetes were not taking medication for their diabetes in 2022 Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countriesIn 2021, diabetes was the direct cause of 16 million deaths and 47% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years Another 530 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and high blood glucose causes around 11% of cardiovascular deaths (1)Since 2000, mortality rates from diabetes have been increasing By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 20% globally between 2000 and 2019 SymptomsSymptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticedSymptoms of diabetes include: feeling very thirstyneeding to urinate more often than usual blurred visionfeeling tiredlosing weight unintentionally Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nervesPeople with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failureDiabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyesMany people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputationType 1 diabetesType 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in high-income countries Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are knownType 2 diabetesType 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vesselsType 2 diabetes is often preventable Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics Early diagnosis is important to prevent the worst effects of type 2 diabetes The best way to detect diabetes early is to get regular check-ups and blood tests with a healthcare provider Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild They may take several years to be noticed Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisenMore than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes was formerly called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in childrenGestational diabetesGestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancyWomen with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the futureGestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptomsImpaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemiaImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes People with IGT or IFG are at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, although this is not inevitablePreventionLifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetesTo help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should: reach and keep a health body weightstay physically active with at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week eat a healthy diet and avoid sugar and saturated fatnot smoke tobaccoDiagnosis and treatmentEarly diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survivalOne of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle Some people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels These can include insulin injections or other medicines Some examples include: metforminsulfonylureassodium-glucose co-transporters type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitorsAlong with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications Additional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes:foot care to treat ulcersscreening and treatment for kidney diseaseeye exams to screen for retinopathy (which causes blindness)WHO responseWHO aims to stimulate and support the adoption of effective measures for the surveillance, prevention and control of diabetes and its complications, particularly in low- and middle-income countries To this end, WHO:provides scientific guidelines for the prevention of major noncommunicable diseases including diabetes;develops norms and standards for diabetes diagnosis and care;builds awareness on the global epidemic of diabetes, marking World Diabetes Day (14 November); andconducts surveillance of diabetes and its risk factorsIn April 2021 WHO launched the Global Diabetes Compact, a global initiative aiming for sustained improvements in diabetes prevention and care, with a particular focus on supporting low- and middle-income countries In May 2021, the World Health Assembly agreed a Resolution on strengthening prevention and control of diabetes In May 2022 the World Health Assembly endorsed five global diabetes coverage targets to be achieved by 2030To learn more about the Global Diabetes Compact, to access

       "  'rather than 6d orbitals, were indeed being filled However, these studies could not unambiguously determine the first element with 5f electrons and therefore the first element in the actinide series;[111] it was thus also referred to as the \"thoride\" or \"uranide\" series until it was later found that the series began with actinium[110][113] In light of these observations and an apparent explanation for the chemistry of transuranic elements, and despite fear among his colleagues that it was a radical idea that would ruin his reputation, Seaborg nevertheless submitted it to Chemical & Engineering News and it gained widespread acceptance; new periodic tables thus placed the actinides below the lanthanides[112] Following its acceptance, the actinide concept proved pivotal in the groundwork for discoveries of heavier elements, such as berkelium in 1949[114] It also supported experimental results for a trend towards +3 oxidation states in the elements beyond americium‚Äîa trend observed in the analogous 4f series[110] Relativistic effects and expansions beyond period 7[edit] Seaborg\\'s subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of superheavy elements in a transactinide series comprising elements from 104 to 121 and a superactinide series of elements from 122 to 153[111] He proposed an extended periodic table with an additional period of 50 elements (thus reaching element 168); this eighth period was derived from an extrapolation of the Aufbau principle and placed elements 121 to 138 in a g-block, in which a new g subshell would be filled[115] Seaborg\\'s model, however, did not take into account relativistic effects resulting from high atomic number and electron orbital speed Burkhard Fricke in 1971[116] and Pekka Pyykk√∂ in 2010[117] used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to Z = 172, and found that the positions of several elements were different from those predicted by Seaborg Although models from Pyykk√∂ and Fricke generally place element 172 as the next noble gas, there is no clear consensus on the electron configurations of elements beyond 120 and thus their placement in an extended periodic table It is now thought that because of relativistic effects, such an extension will feature elements that break the periodicity in known elements, thus posing another hurdle to future periodic table constructs[117] The discovery of tennessine in 2010 filled the last remaining gap in the seventh period Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period Despite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at University of California, Berkeley observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and between dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups 4 and 5 More recent experiments on copernicium and flerovium have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas radon rather than mercury and lead, their respective congeners As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements[2][118] See also[edit] History of chemistry Periodic systems of small molecules The Mystery of Matter: Search for the Elements (PBS film) Discovery of chemical elements Types of periodic tables Notes[edit] ^ They were R2O, R2O2, R2O3, R2O4, R2O5, R2O6, and R2O7 The list was later appended with R2O8 ^ Scerri notes that this table \"does not include elements such as astatine and actinium, which he [Mendeleev] predicted successfully but did not name Neither does it include predictions that were represented just by dashes in Mendeleev‚Äôs periodic systems Among some other failures, not included in the table, is an inert gas element between barium and tantalum, which would have been called ekaxenon, although Mendeleev did not refer to it as such\"[38] ^ He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, such as the halogens and the alkali metals) Other primary groups were rhodium, ruthenium, and palladium; and iridium, osmium,',\n",

       "  'because the nuclear charge increases but the outer electrons are still in the same shell However, going down a column, the radii generally increase, because the outermost electrons are in higher shells that are thus further away from the nucleus[32][118] The first row of each block is abnormally small, due to an effect called kainosymmetry or primogenic repulsion:[119] the 1s, 2p, 3d, and 4f subshells have no inner analogues For example, the 2p orbitals do not experience strong repulsion from the 1s and 2s orbitals, which have quite different angular charge distributions, and hence are not very large; but the 3p orbitals experience strong repulsion from the 2p orbitals, which have similar angular charge distributions Thus higher s-, p-, d-, and f-subshells experience strong repulsion from their inner analogues, which have approximately the same angular distribution of charge, and must expand to avoid this This makes significant differences arise between the small 2p elements, which prefer multiple bonding, and the larger 3p and higher p-elements, which do not[96] Similar anomalies arise for the 1s, 2p, 3d, 4f, and the hypothetical 5g elements:[120] the degree of this first-row anomaly is highest for the s-block, is moderate for the p-block, and is less pronounced for the d- and f-blocks[121] In the transition elements, an inner shell is filling, but the size of the atom is still determined by the outer electrons The increasing nuclear charge across the series and the increased number of inner electrons for shielding somewhat compensate each other, so the decrease in radius is smaller[118] The 4p and 5d atoms, coming immediately after new types of transition series are first introduced, are smaller than would have been expected,[122] because the added core 3d and 4f subshells provide only incomplete shielding of the nuclear charge for the outer electrons Hence for example gallium atoms are slightly smaller than aluminium atoms[96] Together with kainosymmetry, this results in an even-odd difference between the periods (except in the s-block)[k] that is sometimes known as secondary periodicity: elements in even periods have smaller atomic radii and prefer to lose fewer electrons, while elements in odd periods (except the first) differ in the opposite direction Thus for example many properties in the p-block show a zigzag rather than a smooth trend along the group For example, phosphorus and antimony in odd periods of group 15 readily reach the +5 oxidation state, whereas nitrogen, arsenic, and bismuth in even periods prefer to stay at +3[121][123] A similar situation holds for the d-block, with lutetium through tungsten atoms being slightly smaller than yttrium through molybdenum atoms respectively[124][125] Liquid mercury Its liquid state at standard conditions is the result of relativistic effects[126] Thallium and lead atoms are about the same size as indium and tin atoms respectively, but from bismuth to radon the 6p atoms are larger than the analogous 5p atoms This happens because when atomic nuclei become highly charged, special relativity becomes needed to gauge the effect of the nucleus on the electron cloud These relativistic effects result in heavy elements increasingly having differing properties compared to their lighter homologues in the periodic table Spin‚Äìorbit interaction splits the p-subshell: one p-orbital is relativistically stabilized and shrunken (it fills in thallium and lead), but the other two (filling in bismuth through radon) are relativistically destabilized and expanded[96] Relativistic effects also explain why gold is golden and mercury is a liquid at room temperature[126][127] They are expected to become very strong in the late seventh period, potentially leading to a collapse of periodicity[128] Electron configurations are only clearly known until element 108 (hassium), and experimental chemistry beyond 108 has only been done for elements 112 (copernicium) through 115 (moscovium), so the chemical characterization of the heaviest elements remains a topic of current research[129][130] The trend that atomic radii decrease from left to right is also present in ionic radii, though it is more difficult to examine because the most common ions of consecutive elements normally differ in charge Ions with the same electron configuration decrease in size as their atomic number rises, due to increased attraction from the more positively charged nucleus: thus for example ionic radii decrease in the series Se2‚àí, Br‚àí, Rb+, Sr2+, Y3+, Zr4+, Nb5+, Mo6+,',\n",

       "  'magnesium forms Mg2+ rather than Mg+ cations when dissolved in water, because the latter would spontaneously disproportionate into Mg0 and Mg2+ cations This is because the enthalpy of hydration (surrounding the cation with water molecules) increases in magnitude with the charge and radius of the ion In Mg+, the outermost orbital (which determines ionic radius) is still 3s, so the hydration enthalpy is small and insufficient to compensate the energy required to remove the electron; but ionizing again to Mg2+ uncovers the core 2p subshell, making the hydration enthalpy large enough to allow magnesium(II) compounds to form For similar reasons, the common oxidation states of the heavier p-block elements (where the ns electrons become lower in energy than the np) tend to vary by steps of 2, because that is necessary to uncover an inner subshell and decrease the ionic radius (eg Tl+ uncovers 6s, and Tl3+ uncovers 5d, so once thallium loses two electrons it tends to lose the third one as well) Analogous arguments based on orbital hybridization can be used for the less electronegative p-block elements[140][m] Oxidation states of the transition metals The solid dots show common oxidation states, and the hollow dots show possible but unlikely states For transition metals, common oxidation states are nearly always at least +2 for similar reasons (uncovering the next subshell); this holds even for the metals with anomalous dx+1s1 or dx+2s0 configurations (except for silver), because repulsion between d-electrons means that the movement of the second electron from the s- to the d-subshell does not appreciably change its ionisation energy[142] Because ionizing the transition metals further does not uncover any new inner subshells, their oxidation states tend to vary by steps of 1 instead[140] The lanthanides and late actinides generally show a stable +3 oxidation state, removing the outer s-electrons and then (usually) one electron from the (n‚àí2)f-orbitals, that are similar in energy to ns[143] The common and maximum oxidation states of the d- and f-block elements tend to depend on the ionisation energies As the energy difference between the (n‚àí1)d and ns orbitals rises along each transition series, it becomes less energetically favourable to ionize further electrons Thus, the early transition metal groups tend to prefer higher oxidation states, but the +2 oxidation state becomes more stable for the late transition metal groups The highest formal oxidation state thus increases from +3 at the beginning of each d-block row, to +7 or +8 in the middle (eg OsO4), and then decrease to +2 at the end[142] The lanthanides and late actinides usually have high fourth ionisation energies and hence rarely surpass the +3 oxidation state, whereas early actinides have low fourth ionisation energies and so for example neptunium and plutonium can reach +7[110][142][143] The very last actinides go further than the lanthanides towards low oxidation states: mendelevium is more easily reduced to the +2 state than thulium or even europium (the lanthanide with the most stable +2 state, on account of its half-filled f-shell), and nobelium outright favours +2 over +3, in contrast to ytterbium[54] As elements in the same group share the same valence configurations, they usually exhibit similar chemical behaviour For example, the alkali metals in the first group all have one valence electron, and form a very homogeneous class of elements: they are all soft and reactive metals However, there are many factors involved, and groups can often be rather heterogeneous For instance, hydrogen also has one valence electron and is in the same group as the alkali metals, but its chemical behaviour is quite different The stable elements of group 14 comprise a nonmetal (carbon), two semiconductors (silicon and germanium), and two metals (tin and lead); they are nonetheless united by having four valence electrons[144] This often leads to similarities in maximum and minimum oxidation states (eg sulfur and selenium in group 16 both have maximum oxidation state +6, as in SO3 and SeO3, and minimum oxidation state ‚àí2, as in sulfides and selenides); but not always (eg oxygen is not known to form oxidation state +6, despite being in the same group as sulfur and selenium)[58] Electronegativity Electrostatic potential map of a water molecule,',\n",

those which do not are often called nonmetals[32] Some elements can form multiple simple substances with different structures: these are called allotropes For example, diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon[144][n] The metallicity of an element can be predicted from electronic properties When atomic orbitals overlap during metallic or covalent bonding, they create both bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals of equal capacity, with the antibonding orbitals of higher energy Net bonding character occurs when there are more electrons in the bonding orbitals than there are in the antibonding orbitals Metallic bonding is thus possible when the number of electrons delocalized by each atom is less than twice the number of orbitals contributing to the overlap This is the situation for elements in groups 1 through 13; they also have too few valence electrons to form giant covalent structures where all atoms take equivalent positions, and so almost all of them metallise The exceptions are hydrogen and boron, which have too high an ionisation energy Hydrogen thus forms a covalent H2 molecule, and boron forms a giant covalent structure based on icosahedral B12 clusters In a metal, the bonding and antibonding orbitals have overlapping energies, creating a single band that electrons can freely flow through, allowing for electrical conduction[152] Graph of carbon atoms being brought together to form a diamond crystal, demonstrating formation of the electronic band structure and band gap The right graph shows the energy levels as a function of the spacing between atoms When far apart (right side of graph) all the atoms have discrete valence orbitals p and s with the same energies However, when the atoms come closer (left side), their electron orbitals begin to spatially overlap The Pauli exclusion principle prohibits them from having the same energy, so the orbitals hybridize into N molecular orbitals each with a different energy, where N is the number of atoms in the crystal Since N is such a large number, adjacent orbitals are extremely close together in energy so the orbitals can be considered a continuous energy band At the actual diamond crystal cell size (denoted by a), two bands are formed, called the valence and conduction bands, separated by a 55 eV band gap (Here only the valence 2s and 2p electrons have been illustrated; the 1s orbitals do not significantly overlap, so the bands formed from them are much narrower) In group 14, both metallic and covalent bonding become possible In a diamond crystal, covalent bonds between carbon atoms are strong, because they have a small atomic radius and thus the nucleus has more of a hold on the electrons Therefore, the bonding orbitals that result are much lower in energy than the antibonding orbitals, and there is no overlap, so electrical conduction becomes impossible: carbon is a nonmetal However, covalent bonding becomes weaker for larger atoms and the energy gap between the bonding and antibonding orbitals decreases Therefore, silicon and germanium have smaller band gaps and are semiconductors at ambient conditions: electrons can cross the gap when thermally excited (Boron is also a semiconductor at ambient conditions) The band gap disappears in tin, so that tin and lead become metals[152] As the temperature rises, all nonmetals develop some semiconducting properties, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the size of the band gap Thus metals and nonmetals may be distinguished by the temperature dependence of their electrical conductivity: a metal\\'s conductivity lowers as temperature rises (because thermal motion makes it more difficult for the electrons to flow freely), whereas a nonmetal\\'s conductivity rises (as more electrons may be excited to cross the gap)[153] Elements in groups 15 through 17 have too many electrons to form giant covalent molecules that stretch in all three dimensions For the lighter elements, the bonds in small diatomic molecules are so strong that a condensed phase is disfavoured: thus nitrogen (N2),',\n",

       "  \"and the other two (p3/2) are destabilized (Such shifts in the quantum numbers happen for all types of shells, but it makes the biggest difference to the order for the p-shells) It is likely that by element 157, the filled 8s and 8p1/2 shells with four electrons in total have sunk into the core Beyond the core, the next orbitals are 7d and 9s at similar energies, followed by 9p1/2 and 8p3/2 at similar energies, and then a large gap[257] Thus, the 9s and 9p1/2 orbitals in essence replace the 8s and 8p1/2 ones, making elements 157‚Äì172 probably chemically analogous to groups 3‚Äì18: for example, element 164 would appear two places below lead in group 14 under the usual pattern, but is calculated to be very analogous to palladium in group 10 instead[54][266][59][256][128] Thus, it takes fifty-four elements rather than fifty to reach the next noble element after 118[269] However, while these conclusions about elements 157 through 172's chemistry are generally agreed by models,[128][59] there is disagreement on whether the periodic table should be drawn to reflect chemical analogies, or if it should reflect likely formal electron configurations, which should be quite different from earlier periods and are not agreed between sources Discussion about the format of the eighth row thus continues[59][266][267][104] Beyond element 172, calculation is complicated by the 1s electron energy level becoming imaginary Such a situation does have a physical interpretation and does not in itself pose an electronic limit to the periodic table, but the correct way to incorporate such states into multi-electron calculations is still an open question needing to be solved to calculate the periodic table's structure beyond this point[270] Nuclear stability will likely prove a decisive factor constraining the number of possible elements It depends on the balance between the electric repulsion between protons and the strong force binding protons and neutrons together[271] Protons and neutrons are arranged in shells, just like electrons, and so a closed shell can significantly increase stability: the known superheavy nuclei exist because of such a shell closure, probably at around 114‚Äì126 protons and 184 neutrons[270] They are probably close to a predicted island of stability, where superheavy nuclides should be more long-lived than expected: predictions for the longest-lived nuclides on the island range from microseconds to millions of years[104][272][273] It should nonetheless be noted that these are essentially extrapolations into an unknown part of the chart of nuclides, and systematic model uncertainties need to be taken into account[104] As the closed shells are passed, the stabilizing effect should vanish[274] Thus, superheavy nuclides with more than 184 neutrons are expected to have much shorter lifetimes, spontaneously fissioning within 10‚àí15 seconds If this is so, then it would not make sense to consider them chemical elements: IUPAC defines an element to exist only if the nucleus lives longer than 10‚àí14 seconds, the time needed for it to gather an electron cloud Nonetheless, theoretical estimates of half-lives are very model-dependent, ranging over many orders of magnitude[270] The extreme repulsion between protons is predicted to result in exotic nuclear topologies, with bubbles, rings, and tori expected: this further complicates extrapolation[104] It is not clear if any further-out shell closures exist, due to an expected smearing out of distinct nuclear shells (as is already expected for the electron shells at oganesson)[274] Furthermore, even if later shell closures exist, it is not clear if they would allow such heavy elements to exist[275][276][277][178] As such, it may be that the periodic table practically ends around element 120, as elements become too short-lived to observe, and then too short-lived to have chemistry; the era of discovering new elements would thus be close to its end[178][278] If another proton shell closure beyond 126 does exist, then it probably occurs around 164;[275] thus the region where periodicity fails more or less matches the region of instability between the shell closures[128] Alternatively, quark matter may become stable at high mass numbers, in which the nucleus is composed of freely flowing up and down quarks instead of binding them into protons and neutrons; this would create a continent of stability instead of an island[279][280] Other effects may come into play: for example, in very heavy elements the 1s electrons are likely to spend a significant amount of time so close to the nucleus that they are actually inside it,\",\n",

       "  'the energy order for the 55th electron outside the xenon core proceeds as follows in the isoelectronic series of caesium (55 electrons):[53] Cs0: 6s < 6p < 5d < 7s < 4f Ba+: 6s < 5d < 6p < 7s < 4f La2+: 5d < 4f < 6s < 6p < 7s Ce3+: 4f < 5d < 6s < 6p < 7s and in the isoelectronic series of holmium (67 electrons), a Ho0 atom is [Xe]4f116s2, but Er+ is [Xe]4f126s1, Tm2+ through W7+ are [Xe]4f13, and from Re8+ onward the configuration is [Cd]4f145p5 following the hydrogenic order[54][55] Also, the ordering of the orbitals between each ‚â™ changes somewhat throughout each period For example, the ordering in argon and potassium is 3p ‚â™ 4s < 4p ‚â™ 3d; by calcium it has become 3p ‚â™ 4s < 3d < 4p; from scandium to copper it is 3p ‚â™ 3d < 4s < 4p; and from zinc to krypton it is 3p < 3d ‚â™ 4s < 4p[51] as the d-orbitals fall into the core at gallium[56][57] Deeply buried core shells in heavy atoms thus come closer to the hydrogenic order: around osmium (Z = 76) 4f falls below 5p, and around bismuth (Z = 83) 4f falls below 5s as well[54] ^ In fact, electron configurations represent a first-order approximation: an atom really exists in a superposition of multiple configurations, and electrons in an atom are indistinguishable[28] The elements in the d- and f-blocks have multiple configurations separated by small energies and can change configuration depending on the chemical environment[52] In some of the undiscovered g-block elements, mixing of configurations may become so important that the result can no longer be well-described by a single configuration[59] ^ Compounds that would use the 6d orbitals of nihonium as valence orbitals have been theoretically investigated, but they are all expected to be too unstable to observe[71] ^ Properties of the p-block elements nevertheless do affect the succeeding s-block elements The 3s shell in sodium is above a kainosymmetric 2p core, but the 4s shell in potassium is above the much larger 3p core Hence while one would have already expected potassium atoms to be larger than sodium atoms, the size difference is greater than usual[96] ^ There are many lower oxides as well: for example, phosphorus in group 15 forms two oxides, P2O3 and P2O5[113] ^ The normally \"forbidden\" intermediate oxidation states may be stabilized by forming dimers, as in [Cl3Ga‚ÄìGaCl3]2‚àí (gallium in the +2 oxidation state) or S2F10 (sulfur in the +5 oxidation state)[140] Some compounds that appear to be in such intermediate oxidation states are actually mixed-valence compounds, such as Sb2O4, which contains both Sb(III) and Sb(V)[141] ^ The boundary between dispersion forces and metallic bonding is gradual, like that between ionic and covalent bonding Characteristic metallic properties do not appear in small mercury clusters, but do appear in large ones[151] ^ All this describes the situation at standard pressure Under sufficiently high pressure, the band gaps of any solid drop to zero and metallization occurs Thus for example at about 170 kbar iodine becomes a metal,[152] and metallic hydrogen should form at pressures of about four million atmospheres[154] See metallization pressure for values for all nonmetals ^ Descriptions of the structures formed by the elements can be found throughout Greenwood and Earnshaw There are two borderline cases Arsenic\\'s most stable form conducts electricity like a metal, but the bonding is significantly more localized to the nearest neighbours than it is for the similar structures of antimony and bismuth,[157] and unlike normal metals it does not have a long liquid range, but rather sublimes instead Hence its structure is better treated as network covalent[158] Carbon as graphite shows metallic conduction parallel to its planes,',\n",

of people living with diabetes rose from 200 million in 1990 to 830 million in 2022 Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countriesMore than half of people living with diabetes did not take medication for their diabetes in 2022 Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countriesDiabetes causes blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputationIn 2021, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused over 2 million deaths In addition, around 11% of cardiovascular deaths were caused by high blood glucoseA healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetesDiabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complicationsOverviewDiabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels In 2022, 14% of adults aged 18 years and older were living with diabetes, an increase from 7% in 1990 More than half (59%) of adults aged 30 years and over living with diabetes were not taking medication for their diabetes in 2022 Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countriesIn 2021, diabetes was the direct cause of 16 million deaths and 47% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years Another 530 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and high blood glucose causes around 11% of cardiovascular deaths (1)Since 2000, mortality rates from diabetes have been increasing By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 20% globally between 2000 and 2019 SymptomsSymptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticedSymptoms of diabetes include: feeling very thirstyneeding to urinate more often than usual blurred visionfeeling tiredlosing weight unintentionally Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nervesPeople with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failureDiabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyesMany people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputationType 1 diabetesType 1

the majority of them live in high-income countries Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are knownType 2 diabetesType 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vesselsType 2 diabetes is often preventable Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics Early diagnosis is important to prevent the worst effects of type 2 diabetes The best way to detect diabetes early is to get regular check-ups and blood tests with a healthcare provider Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild They may take several years to be noticed Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisenMore than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes was formerly called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in childrenGestational diabetesGestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancyWomen with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the futureGestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptomsImpaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemiaImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes People with IGT or IFG are at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, although this is not inevitablePreventionLifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetesTo help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should: reach and keep a health body weightstay physically active with at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week eat a healthy diet and avoid sugar and saturated fatnot smoke tobaccoDiagnosis and treatmentEarly diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survivalOne of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle Some people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels These can include insulin injections or other medicines Some examples include: metforminsulfonylureassodium-glucose co-transporters type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitorsAlong with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications Additional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes:foot care to treat ulcersscreening and treatment for kidney diseaseeye exams to screen for retinopathy (which causes blindness)WHO responseWHO aims to stimulate and support the adoption of effective measures for the surveillance, prevention and control of diabetes and its complications, particularly in low- and middle-income countries To this end, WHO:provides scientific guidelines for the prevention of major noncommunicable diseases including diabetes;develops norms and standards for diabetes diagnosis and care;builds awareness on the global epidemic of diabetes, marking World Diabetes Day (14 November);

       "  \"and the other two (p3/2) are destabilized (Such shifts in the quantum numbers happen for all types of shells, but it makes the biggest difference to the order for the p-shells) It is likely that by element 157, the filled 8s and 8p1/2 shells with four electrons in total have sunk into the core Beyond the core, the next orbitals are 7d and 9s at similar energies, followed by 9p1/2 and 8p3/2 at similar energies, and then a large gap[257] Thus, the 9s and 9p1/2 orbitals in essence replace the 8s and 8p1/2 ones, making elements 157‚Äì172 probably chemically analogous to groups 3‚Äì18: for example, element 164 would appear two places below lead in group 14 under the usual pattern, but is calculated to be very analogous to palladium in group 10 instead[54][266][59][256][128] Thus, it takes fifty-four elements rather than fifty to reach the next noble element after 118[269] However, while these conclusions about elements 157 through 172's chemistry are generally agreed by models,[128][59] there is disagreement on whether the periodic table should be drawn to reflect chemical analogies, or if it should reflect likely formal electron configurations, which should be quite different from earlier periods and are not agreed between sources Discussion about the format of the eighth row thus continues[59][266][267][104] Beyond element 172, calculation is complicated by the 1s electron energy level becoming imaginary Such a situation does have a physical interpretation and does not in itself pose an electronic limit to the periodic table, but the correct way to incorporate such states into multi-electron calculations is still an open question needing to be solved to calculate the periodic table's structure beyond this point[270] Nuclear stability will likely prove a decisive factor constraining the number of possible elements It depends on the balance between the electric repulsion between protons and the strong force binding protons and neutrons together[271] Protons and neutrons are arranged in shells, just like electrons, and so a closed shell can significantly increase stability: the known superheavy nuclei exist because of such a shell closure, probably at around 114‚Äì126 protons and 184 neutrons[270] They are probably close to a predicted island of stability, where superheavy nuclides should be more long-lived than expected: predictions for the longest-lived nuclides on the island range from microseconds to millions of years[104][272][273] It should nonetheless be noted that these are essentially extrapolations into an unknown part of the chart of nuclides, and systematic model uncertainties need to be taken into account[104] As the closed shells are passed, the stabilizing effect should vanish[274] Thus, superheavy nuclides with more than 184 neutrons are expected to have much shorter lifetimes, spontaneously fissioning within 10‚àí15 seconds If this is so, then it would not make sense to consider them chemical elements: IUPAC defines an element to exist only if the nucleus lives longer than 10‚àí14 seconds, the time needed for it to gather an electron cloud Nonetheless, theoretical estimates of half-lives are very model-dependent, ranging over many orders of magnitude[270] The extreme repulsion between protons is predicted to result in exotic nuclear topologies, with bubbles, rings, and tori expected: this further complicates extrapolation[104] It is not clear if any further-out shell closures exist, due to an expected smearing out of distinct nuclear shells (as is already expected for the electron shells at oganesson)[274] Furthermore, even if later shell closures exist, it is not clear if they would allow such heavy elements to exist[275][276][277][178] As such, it may be that the periodic table practically ends around element 120, as elements become too short-lived to observe, and then too short-lived to have chemistry; the era of discovering new elements would thus be close to its end[178][278] If another proton shell closure beyond 126 does exist, then it probably occurs around 164;[275] thus the region where periodicity fails more or less matches the region of instability between the shell closures[128] Alternatively, quark matter may become stable at high mass numbers, in which the nucleus is composed of freely flowing up and down quarks instead of binding them into protons and neutrons; this would create a continent of stability instead of an island[279][280] Other effects may come into play: for example, in very heavy elements the 1s electrons are likely to spend a significant amount of time so close to the nucleus that they are actually inside it,\",\n",

2024 Key factsThe number of people living with diabetes rose from 200 million in 1990 to 830 million in 2022 Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countriesMore than half of people living with diabetes did not take medication for their diabetes in 2022 Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countriesDiabetes causes blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputationIn 2021, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused over 2 million deaths In addition, around 11% of cardiovascular deaths were caused by high blood glucoseA healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetesDiabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complicationsOverviewDiabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels In 2022, 14% of adults aged 18 years and older were living with diabetes, an increase from 7% in 1990 More than half (59%) of adults aged 30 years and over living with diabetes were not taking medication for their diabetes in 2022 Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countriesIn 2021, diabetes was the direct cause of 16 million deaths and 47% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years Another 530 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and high blood glucose causes around 11% of cardiovascular deaths (1)Since 2000, mortality rates from diabetes have been increasing By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 20% globally between 2000 and 2019 SymptomsSymptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticedSymptoms of diabetes include: feeling very thirstyneeding to urinate more often than usual blurred visionfeeling tiredlosing weight unintentionally Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nervesPeople with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failureDiabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyesMany people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to

the majority of them live in high-income countries Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are knownType 2 diabetesType 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vesselsType 2 diabetes is often preventable Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics Early diagnosis is important to prevent the worst effects of type 2 diabetes The best way to detect diabetes early is to get regular check-ups and blood tests with a healthcare provider Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild They may take several years to be noticed Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisenMore than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes was formerly called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in childrenGestational diabetesGestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancyWomen with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the futureGestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptomsImpaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemiaImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes People with IGT or IFG are at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, although this is not inevitablePreventionLifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetesTo help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should: reach and keep a health body weightstay physically active with at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week eat a healthy diet and avoid sugar and saturated fatnot smoke tobaccoDiagnosis and treatmentEarly diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survivalOne of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle Some people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels These can include insulin injections or other medicines Some examples include: metforminsulfonylureassodium-glucose co-transporters type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitorsAlong with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications Additional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes:foot care to treat ulcersscreening and treatment for kidney diseaseeye exams to screen for retinopathy (which causes blindness)WHO responseWHO aims to stimulate and support the adoption of effective measures for the surveillance, prevention and control of diabetes and its complications, particularly in low- and middle-income countries To this end, WHO:provides scientific guidelines for the prevention of major noncommunicable diseases including diabetes;develops norms and standards for diabetes diagnosis and care;builds awareness on the global epidemic of diabetes, marking World Diabetes Day (14 November);
